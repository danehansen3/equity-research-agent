Note 2. Pioneer Natural Resources Merger

On May 3, 2024, the Corporation acquired Pioneer Natural Resources Company ("Pioneer"), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. The acquisition included over 850 thousand net acres in the Midland Basin of West Texas and proved reserves in excess of 2 billion oil-equivalent barrels. In connection with the acquisition, we issued 545 million shares of ExxonMobil common stock having a fair value of $63 billion on the acquisition date, and assumed debt with a fair value of $5 billion.
The transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.

| 17 | (1) Current assets and current liabilities consist primarily of accounts receivable and payable, with their respective fair values approximating historical values given their short-term duration, expectation of insignificant bad debt expense, and our credit rating.                                                                                         |         |
| 18 | (2) Property, plant and equipment was preliminarily valued using the income approach. Significant inputs and assumptions used in the income approach included estimates for commodity prices, future oil and gas production profiles, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. Collectively, these inputs are Level 3 inputs. |         |
| 19 | (3) Long-term debt was valued using market prices as of the acquisition date, which reflects the use of Level 1 inputs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         |
| 20 | (4) Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences in the tax basis and acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |         |

Adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the date of acquisition, as we continue to evaluate the information necessary to complete the analysis.                                                                   |         |

The historical financial information was adjusted to give effect to the pro forma events that were directly attributable to the merger and factually supportable. The unaudited pro forma consolidated results are not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations actually would have been had the merger been completed on January 1, 2023. In addition, the unaudited pro forma consolidated results reflect pro forma adjustments primarily related to conforming Pioneer's accounting policies to ExxonMobil, additional depreciation expense related to the fair value adjustment of the acquired property, plant and equipment, our capital structure, Pioneer's transaction-related costs, and applicable income tax impacts of the pro forma adjustments.
Our transaction costs to effect the acquisition were immaterial.

Note 3. Litigation and Other Contingencies


Litigation

A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters which management believes should be disclosed.
State and local governments and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States and its territories have filed a number of legal proceedings against several oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting unprecedented legal and equitable relief for various alleged injuries purportedly connected to climate change. These lawsuits assert a variety of novel, untested claims under statutory and common law. Additional such lawsuits may be filed. We believe the legal and factual theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless and represent an inappropriate attempt to use the court system to usurp the proper role of policymakers in addressing the societal challenges of climate change.
Local governments in Louisiana have filed unprecedented legal proceedings against a number of oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting compensation for the restoration of coastal marsh erosion in the state. We believe the factual and legal theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless.
While the outcome of any litigation can be unpredictable, we believe the likelihood is remote that the ultimate outcomes of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. We will continue to defend vigorously against these claims.

Other Contingencies

The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at September 30, 2024, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. Where it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation of the maximum potential amount of future payments, future performance is expected to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Corporation had $634 million and $800 million of collateral under master netting arrangements not offset against the derivatives on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to initial margin requirements.
The Corporation may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Under this method, the change in the carrying value of the financial instruments due to foreign exchange fluctuations is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation has designated $3.4 billion of its Euro-denominated debt and related accrued interest as a net investment hedge of its European business. The net investment hedge is deemed to be perfectly effective.
The Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $237 million and undrawn long-term committed lines of credit of $1,613 million as of the end of third quarter 2024.

Derivative Instruments

The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity, and the complementary nature of its business segments reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line “Sales and other operating revenue" and in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in “Cash Flows from Operating Activities”. The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, or results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.
Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting, and monitoring of derivative activity.
The net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was as follows:

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Sales and other operating revenue include both revenue within the scope of ASC 606 and outside the scope of ASC 606. Trade receivables in Notes and accounts receivable – net reported on the Balance Sheet also includes both receivables within the scope of ASC 606 and those outside the scope of ASC 606. Revenue and receivables outside the scope of ASC 606 primarily relate to physically settled commodity contracts accounted for as derivatives. Contractual terms, credit quality, and type of customer are generally similar between those revenues and receivables within the scope of ASC 606 and those outside it.

Note 9. Divestment Activities

Through September 30, 2024, the Corporation realized proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion and net after-tax earnings of $0.5 billion from its divestment activities. This included the sale of the Santa Ynez Unit and associated facilities in California, certain conventional and unconventional assets in the United States, as well as other smaller divestments.
In 2023, the Corporation realized proceeds of approximately $4.1 billion and recognized net after-tax earnings of approximately $0.6 billion from its divestment activities. This included the sale of the Aera Energy joint venture, Esso Thailand Ltd., the Billings Refinery, certain unconventional assets in the United States, as well as other smaller divestments.
In February 2022, the Corporation signed an agreement with Seplat Energy Offshore Limited for the sale of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited. The agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent and government approvals. In mid-2022, a Nigerian court issued an order to halt transition activities and enter into arbitration with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In June 2024, the court order was lifted and arbitration suspended. The closing date and any loss on sale will depend on resolution of the conditions precedent and government approvals.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Overview

During the third quarter, crude prices remained in the middle of the 10-year historical range (2010-2019), though decreased slightly versus the second quarter, reflecting uncertainty in supply and demand balances. Natural gas prices strengthened during the quarter and moved toward the top half of the 10-year range, supported by summer demand in North America and supply concerns in Europe. Industry refining margins declined versus the second quarter, and moved to the low end of the 10-year range, as record global demand was more than met by additional supply. Chemical margins improved slightly compared to the second quarter due to lower North America feed costs, though remained well below the 10-year range, as industry bottom-of-cycle conditions continued driven by oversupply in Asia.

Recent Mergers and Acquisitions


On May 3, 2024, ExxonMobil acquired Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. See "Note 2. Pioneer Natural Resources Merger" of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.


Selected Earnings Factor Definitions

The updated earnings factors introduced in the first quarter 2024 provide additional visibility into drivers of our business results. The company evaluates these factors periodically to determine if any enhancements may provide helpful insights to the market. Listed below are descriptions of the earnings factors:
Advantaged Volume Growth. Represents earnings impacts from change in volume/mix from advantaged assets, strategic projects, and high-value products. 

•Advantaged Assets (Advantaged growth projects). Includes Permian (heritage Permian (1) and Pioneer), Guyana, Brazil, and LNG.

•Strategic Projects. Includes (i) the following completed projects: Rotterdam Hydrocracker, Corpus Christi Chemical Complex, Baton Rouge Polypropylene, Beaumont Crude Expansion, Baytown Chemical Expansion, Permian Crude Venture, and the 2022 Baytown advanced recycling facility; and (ii) the following projects still to be completed: Fawley Hydrofiner, China Chemical Complex, Singapore Resid Upgrade, Strathcona Renewable Diesel, ProxximaTM Venture, USGC Reconfiguration, additional advanced recycling projects under evaluation worldwide, and additional projects in plan yet to be publicly announced. 
•High-Value Products. Includes performance products and lower-emission fuels. Performance products (performance chemicals, performance lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end-users. Lower-emission fuels refers to fuels with lower life cycle emissions than conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.
Base Volume. Represents all volume/mix factors not included in Advantaged Volume Growth defined above.
Structural Cost Savings. Represents after-tax earnings effects of Structural Cost Savings as defined on page 21, including cash operating expenses related to divestments that were previously in the "volume/mix" factor.
Expenses. Represents all expenses otherwise not included in other earnings factors.
Timing Effects. Represents timing effects that are primarily related to unsettled derivatives (mark-to-market) and other earnings impacts driven by timing differences between the settlement of derivatives and their offsetting physical commodity realizations (due to LIFO inventory accounting).
(1) Heritage Permian basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items

Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP) are earnings (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter. The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item for an individual segment in a given quarter may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several periods or several segments. Earnings (loss) excluding identified items does include non-operational earnings events or impacts that are generally below the $250 million threshold utilized for Identified Items. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Structural Cost Savings

Structural Cost Savings describes decreases in cash opex excluding energy and production taxes as a result of operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, divestment-related reductions, and other cost-savings measures that are expected to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Relative to 2019, estimated cumulative Structural Cost Savings totaled $11.3 billion, which included an additional $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2024. The total change between periods in expenses below will reflect both Structural Cost Savings and other changes in spend, including market factors, such as inflation and foreign exchange impacts, as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated with new operations, mergers and acquisitions, new business venture development, and early-stage projects. Estimates of cumulative annual structural savings may be revised depending on whether cost reductions realized in prior periods are determined to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels.

REVIEW OF THIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS

ExxonMobil’s third quarter 2024 earnings were $8.6 billion, compared to $9.1 billion a year earlier. The decrease in earnings was mainly driven by weaker industry refining margins and higher Upstream depreciation, partially offset by favorable timing effects from derivatives mark-to-market impacts and increased volumes from advantaged Upstream investments in the Permian and Guyana. Capital and exploration expenditures were $7.2 billion, up $1.1 billion from third quarter 2023.
Earnings for the first nine months of 2024 were $26.1 billion, compared to $28.4 billion a year earlier. Capital and exploration expenditures were $20.0 billion, up $1.5 billion from the first nine months of 2023. The Corporation distributed $12.3 billion in dividends to shareholders and repurchased $13.8 billion of common stock.

|  1 | Upstream Third Quarter Earnings Factor Analysis |
|  2 | (millions of dollars)                           |

Price – Price impacts decreased earnings by $620 million, driven by a decrease in liquids realizations, partly offset by an increase in natural gas realizations.
Advantaged Volume Growth – Higher volumes from advantaged assets increased earnings by $1,070 million, driven by record Permian production, including the Pioneer acquisition and growth in heritage Permian (2), and higher production in Guyana..
Base Volume – Base volumes increased earnings by $10 million. 

Structural Cost Savings – Increased earnings by $230 million. 

Expenses – Higher expenses decreased earnings by $500 million, primarily from depreciation.
Other – All other items decreased earnings by $200 million, mainly driven by unfavorable tax impacts.
Timing Effects – Less unfavorable timing effects from derivatives mark-to-market impacts increased earnings by $30 million. 
Identified Items (1) – 3Q 2023 $(14) million loss driven by additional European taxes.

Price – Price impacts decreased earnings by $10 million, driven by lower natural gas realizations partially offset by higher liquids realizations.
Advantaged Volume Growth – Higher volumes from advantaged assets increased earnings by $2,750 million, driven by record Permian production, including the Pioneer acquisition and growth in heritage Permian (2), and record production in Guyana.
Base Volume – Lower base volumes decreased earnings by $440 million, mainly driven by divestments and government-mandated curtailments.

Structural Cost Savings – Increased earnings by $550 million, driven by operational efficiencies and divestments. 

Expenses – Higher expenses decreased earnings by $1,000 million, primarily from increased depreciation.
Other – All other items, mainly unfavorable tax and forex impacts, and Pioneer-related transaction costs, decreased earnings by $530 million.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices. 
Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements. 
Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels as a result of production limits or sanctions imposed by governments.
Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. 
Growth and Other comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.

| 17 | Because of the ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions. |                                 |                                |          |          |        |
Cash flow from operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2024 was $17.7 billion, an increase of $0.8 billion from the comparable 2023 period primarily due to favorable working capital. 
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $42.8 billion for the first nine months of 2024, $1.1 billion higher than 2023. Net income including noncontrolling interests was $27.1 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion from the prior year period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $16.9 billion for depreciation and depletion was up $4.0 billion from 2023. Changes in operational working capital were a reduction of $0.3 billion during the period. All other items net decreased cash flows by $0.9 billion in 2024 versus a contribution of $1.5 billion in 2023. See the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for additional details.
Investing activities for the first nine months of 2024 used net cash of $15.7 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $17.5 billion was $1.8 billion higher than 2023. Proceeds from asset sales were $1.8 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion compared to the prior year. Net investments and advances decreased $0.2 billion from $0.9 billion in 2023. Cash acquired from mergers and acquisitions during the first nine months of 2024 was $0.8 billion.
Net cash used in financing activities was $31.6 billion in the first nine months of 2024, including $13.8 billion for the purchase of 119.8 million shares of ExxonMobil stock, as part of the previously announced buyback program, and $1.3 billion to repay Pioneer convertible debt. This compares to net cash used in financing activities of $24.7 billion in the prior year. Total debt at the end of the third quarter of 2024 was $42.6 billion compared to $41.6 billion at year-end 2023. The Corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 13.3 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared to 16.4 percent at year-end 2023. The net debt to capital ratio (1) was 5.4 percent at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 0.9 percentage points from year-end 2023. The Corporation's capital allocation priorities are investing in competitively advantaged, high-return projects; maintaining a strong balance sheet; and sharing our success with our shareholders through more consistent share repurchases and a growing dividend. The Corporation distributed a total of $12.3 billion to shareholders in the first nine months of 2024 through dividends.
The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. The Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion and undrawn long-term committed lines of credit of $1.6 billion as of the end of third quarter 2024.
The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include strategic fit, cost synergies, potential for future growth, low cost of supply, and attractive valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock, or both.
Litigation and other contingencies are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
(1) Net debt is total debt of $42.6 billion less $26.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash . Net debt to capital ratio is net debt divided by net debt plus total equity of $276.4 billion. Total debt is the sum of notes and loans payable and long-term debt, as reported in the consolidated balance sheet.

Contractual Obligations

The Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition. Through the third quarter of 2024, the Corporation entered into two long-term purchase agreements with an estimated total obligation of approximately $3.0 billion. The Corporation assumed take-or-pay obligations of $4.9 billion associated with the Pioneer acquisition that include long-term purchase, gathering, processing, and transportation commitments.

Risk Factors" of ExxonMobil’s 2023 Form 10-K.
Forward-looking and other statements regarding environmental and other sustainability efforts and aspirations are not an indication that these statements are material to investors or require disclosure in our filing with the SEC. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking environmental and other sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future, including future rule-making.
Actions needed to advance ExxonMobil’s 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on ExxonMobil’s Global Outlook (Outlook) research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and development of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and ExxonMobil’s business plans will be updated accordingly. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect investment decisions made by ExxonMobil or its affiliates. Individual projects or opportunities may advance based on a number of factors, including availability of supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emission investments is based on our corporate plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set, public policy support, and focused on returns.
The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Information about market risks for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, does not differ materially from that discussed under Item 7A of the registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2023.
The impacts of price fluctuations on 2024 earnings have been revised to reflect the acquisition of Pioneer on an annualized basis. A $1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized price of oil would have approximately a $650 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. Similarly, a $0.10 per thousand cubic feet change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $155 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. 
Crude oil, natural gas, petroleum product, and chemical prices fluctuate in response to changing market forces. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, results of trading activities, taxes and other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. Accordingly, changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As indicated in the certifications in Exhibit 31 of this report, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have evaluated the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to them in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. There were no changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.
In the second quarter of 2024, ExxonMobil started the process of integrating Pioneer into its operations and internal control processes, resulting in some of Pioneer's historical internal controls being superseded by ExxonMobil's internal controls. This integration is expected to continue into 2025. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION


ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

ExxonMobil has elected to use a $1 million threshold for disclosing environmental proceedings.
As reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2024, XTO Energy, Inc. (XTO) received a Notice of Violation from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on March 9, 2022 regarding certain well pad production facility sites in Butler County, Pennsylvania, alleging violations of certain federal New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and Pennsylvania’s Title V operating permit regulations. In October 2024, XTO entered into a consent decree to resolve these alleged violations upon payment of a $4.0 million penalty. On October 24, 2024, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed the consent decree with the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which was published in the Federal Register on October 30, 2024, and will be open to public comment for 30 days before the District Court may approve it.
