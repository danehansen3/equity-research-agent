This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is a combined report being filed by Dow Inc. and The Dow Chemical Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (“TDCC” and together with Dow Inc., “Dow” or the "Company") due to the parent/subsidiary relationship between Dow Inc. and TDCC. The information reflected in the report is equally applicable to both Dow Inc. and TDCC, except where otherwise noted. Each of Dow Inc. and TDCC is filing information in this report on its own behalf and neither company makes any representation to the information relating to the other company.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Certain statements in this report are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements often address expected future business and financial performance, financial condition, and other matters, and often contain words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “opportunity,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” “would” and similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words or phrases.
Forward-looking statements are based on current assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that are beyond Dow’s control, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements and speak only as of the date the statements were made. These factors include, but are not limited to: sales of Dow’s products; Dow’s expenses, future revenues and profitability; any global and regional economic impacts of a pandemic or other public health-related risks and events on Dow’s business; any sanctions, export restrictions, supply chain disruptions or increased economic uncertainty related to the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; capital requirements and need for and availability of financing; unexpected barriers in the development of technology, including with respect to Dow's contemplated capital and operating projects; Dow's ability to realize its commitment to carbon neutrality on the contemplated timeframe, including the completion and success of its integrated ethylene cracker and derivatives facility in Alberta, Canada; size of the markets for Dow’s products and services and ability to compete in such markets; failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; the rate and degree of market acceptance of Dow’s products; significant litigation and environmental matters and related contingencies and unexpected expenses; the success of competing technologies that are or may become available; the ability to protect Dow’s intellectual property in the United States and abroad; developments related to contemplated restructuring activities and proposed divestitures or acquisitions such as workforce reduction, manufacturing facility and/or asset closure and related exit and disposal activities, and the benefits and costs associated with each of the foregoing; fluctuations in energy and raw material prices; management of process safety and product stewardship; changes in relationships with Dow’s significant customers and suppliers; changes in public sentiment and political leadership; increased concerns about plastics in the environment and lack of a circular economy for plastics at scale; changes in consumer preferences and demand; changes in laws and regulations, political conditions or industry development; global economic and capital markets conditions, such as inflation, market uncertainty, interest and currency exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices; business, logistics, and supply disruptions; security threats, such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; weather events and natural disasters; disruptions in Dow’s information technology networks and systems, including the impact of cyberattacks; and risks related to Dow’s separation from DowDuPont Inc. such as Dow’s obligation to indemnify DuPont de Nemours, Inc. and/or Corteva, Inc. for certain liabilities.
Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. A detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” contained in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These are not the only risks and uncertainties that Dow faces. There may be other risks and uncertainties that Dow is unable to identify at this time or that Dow does not currently expect to have a material impact on its business. If any of those risks or uncertainties develops into an actual event, it could have a material adverse effect on Dow’s business. Dow Inc. and TDCC assume no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by securities and other applicable laws.

NOTE 1 – CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Basis of Presentation

Dow Inc. is the direct parent company of The Dow Chemical Company and its consolidated subsidiaries ("TDCC" and together with Dow Inc., "Dow" or the "Company"). The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Dow Inc. and TDCC were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which, in the opinion of management, are considered necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. These statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the combined Dow Inc. and TDCC Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("2023 10-K").
As a result of the parent/subsidiary relationship between Dow Inc. and TDCC, and considering that the financial statements and disclosures of each company are substantially similar, the companies are filing a combined report for this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The information reflected in the report is equally applicable to both Dow Inc. and TDCC, except where otherwise noted. Transactions between TDCC and Dow Inc. are treated as related party transactions for TDCC.
Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term "Union Carbide" means Union Carbide Corporation and the term "Dow Silicones" means Dow Silicones Corporation, both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.

NOTE 2 – RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE


Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance

On January 1, 2024, the Company adopted the amendments in Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-02, "Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method" and elected to account for certain tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, as provided by the ASU. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of tax equity investments in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). The adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Guidance Issued But Not Adopted at September 30, 2024

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures," which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses, allowing financial statement users to better understand the components of a segment's profit or loss to assess potential future cash flows for each reportable segment and the entity as a whole. The amendments expand a public entity's segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, clarifying when an entity may report one or more additional measures to assess segment performance, requiring enhanced interim disclosures, providing new disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and requiring other new disclosures. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of the ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures," which is intended to enhance the transparency, decision usefulness and effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require a public entity to disclose a tabular tax rate reconciliation, using both percentages and currency, with specific categories. A public entity is also required to provide a qualitative description of the states and local jurisdictions that make up the majority of the effect of the state and local income tax category and the net amount of income taxes paid, disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and also disaggregated by individual jurisdictions. The amendments also remove certain disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial. The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. The adoption of the ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

SEC Final Rules Not Adopted at September 30, 2024

In March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted final rules under SEC Release Nos. 33-11275 and 34-99678, "The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors," which requires registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. The final rules include requirements to disclose material climate-related risks; activities to mitigate or adapt to such risks; information about the board of directors' oversight of climate-related risks and management’s role in managing material climate-related risks; and information on any climate-related targets or goals that are material to the registrant's business, results of operations, or financial condition. Registrants are also required to disclose the financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions in the notes to the financial statements. Certain large registrants are also required to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, when material. The final rules include a phased-in compliance period for all registrants. As a large accelerated filer, most disclosure requirements are effective for the Company beginning with the year ending December 31, 2025. GHG emissions disclosures are required for the year ending December 31, 2026. The Company will also be required to obtain limited assurance on its Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions disclosures beginning with the year ending December 31, 2029, with reasonable assurance required beginning with the year ending December 31, 2033. In April 2024, the SEC issued an order to stay the final rules until various legal challenges are resolved by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the final rules on its consolidated financial statements and annual disclosures.

NOTE 3 – REVENUE


Revenue Recognition

The majority of the Company's revenue is derived from product sales. The Company's revenue related to product sales was 97 percent and 98 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively (98 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023). The remaining sales were primarily related to the Company's insurance operations and licensing of patents and technologies. Product sales consist of sales of the Company's products to manufacturers and distributors. The Company considers order confirmations or purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master supply agreements, to be contracts with a customer. The Company enters into licensing arrangements in which it licenses certain rights of its patents and technology to customers. Revenue from the Company’s licenses for patents and technology is derived from sales-based royalties and licensing arrangements based on billing schedules established in each contract.

Remaining Performance Obligations

Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations. At September 30, 2024, the Company had unfulfilled performance obligations of $775 million ($744 million at December 31, 2023) related to the licensing of technology. The Company expects revenue to be recognized for the remaining performance obligations over the next five years.
The Company has additional remaining performance obligations for product sales that have expected durations of one year or less, product sales of materials delivered through a pipeline for which the Company has elected the "right to invoice" practical expedient, and variable consideration attributable to royalties for licenses of patents and technology. The Company has received advance payments from customers related to long-term supply agreements that are deferred and recognized over the life of the contract, with remaining contract terms that range up to 19 years. The Company will have rights to future consideration for revenue recognized when product is delivered to the customer. These payments are included in "Accrued and other current liabilities" and "Other noncurrent obligations" in the consolidated balance sheets.

Disaggregation of Revenue

The Company disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by operating segment and business, as the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows. See details in the tables below:

Contract Assets and Liabilities

The Company receives payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets include amounts related to the Company's contractual right to consideration for completed performance obligations not yet invoiced. Contract liabilities include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are recognized in revenue when the performance obligations are met. "Contract liabilities - current" primarily reflects deferred revenue from prepayments from customers for product to be delivered in 12 months or less and royalty payments that are deferred and will be recognized in 12 months or less. "Contract liabilities - noncurrent" includes advance payments that the Company has received from customers related to long-term supply agreements and royalty payments that are deferred and recognized over the life of the contract.
Revenue recognized in the first nine months of 2024 from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was approximately $135 million (approximately $205 million in the first nine months of 2023). In the first nine months of 2024, the amount of contract assets reclassified to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional was insignificant (approximately $45 million in the first nine months of 2023).
The following table summarizes contract assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:
|    |                                       |                                       |              |              |    |       |

NOTE 4 – ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES


Divestiture of the Flexible Packaging Laminating Adhesives Business

On May 2, 2024, the Company announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its flexible packaging laminating adhesives business, within Dow's Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, to Arkema S.A. for approximately $150 million. The divestiture includes five manufacturing sites in the United States, Italy and Mexico as well as the associated inventory, customer contracts and lists, process technology and certain intellectual property. The Company is targeting to close the transaction by the end of 2024, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions.

Acquisition of North American Polyethylene Recycler

On August 1, 2024, the Company acquired Circulus Holdings, PBLLC, a U.S. company that recycles plastic waste into post-consumer resin, for a cash purchase of approximately $130 million. The acquisition includes two facilities in the United States with a total recycling capacity of 50,000 metric tons per year and supports Dow's efforts to transform plastic waste and other forms of alternative feedstocks into 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually by 2030. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition were recorded at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date, including property of $74 million and intangible assets, consisting primarily of technology and know-how, of $22 million, with the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired of $36 million allocated to goodwill. These amounts are subject to adjustment upon completion of the valuation process.

NOTE 5 – RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET RELATED CHARGES - NET

Charges for restructuring programs and other asset related charges, which include asset impairments, are recorded in "Restructuring and asset related charges - net" in the consolidated statements of income. For additional information on the Company's restructuring programs, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K.

2023 Restructuring Program

On January 25, 2023, the Dow Inc. Board of Directors ("Board") approved restructuring actions to achieve the Company's structural cost improvement initiatives in response to the continued economic impact from the global recessionary environment and to enhance its agility and long-term competitiveness across the economic cycle. These actions are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2025. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company recorded additional pretax restructuring charges of $8 million for asset write-downs and write-offs related to the shutdown of certain polyurethanes assets within the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded additional pretax restructuring charges of $7 million for asset write-downs and write-offs related to the shutdown of certain silicones assets within the Performance Materials & Coatings segment. The impacted facilities are expected to be shutdown by the end of 2025. Additionally, the Company recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $16 million for severance and related benefit costs and a pretax restructuring charge of $1 million for additional asset write-downs and write-offs, related to Corporate. 
The following table summarizes the activities related to the 2023 Restructuring Program, including segment information:

Supplier Finance Program

The Company facilitates a supply chain financing (“SCF”) program in the ordinary course of business in order to extend payment terms with vendors. Under the terms of this program, a vendor can voluntarily enter into an agreement with a participating financial intermediary to sell its receivables due from the Company. The vendor receives payment from the financial intermediary, and the Company pays the financial intermediary on the terms originally negotiated with the vendor, which generally range from 90 to 120 days. The vendor negotiates the terms of the agreements directly with the financial intermediary and the Company is not a party to that agreement. The financial intermediary may allow the participating vendor to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which may provide the vendor with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company does not provide guarantees related to the SCF program. At September 30, 2024, outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under the SCF program were $304 million ($285 million at December 31, 2023), included in “Accounts payable – Trade” in the consolidated balance sheets.

NOTE 7 – INCOME TAXES

As the financial statements for Dow Inc. and TDCC are substantially similar, including the provision for income taxes, the following income tax discussion does not include reference to TDCC's provision for income taxes or its effective tax rate.
The Company's effective tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, where income is earned, the level of income relative to tax attributes and the level of equity earnings, since most earnings from the Company's equity method investments are taxed at the joint venture level. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of $84 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.9 percent ($90 million in the third quarter of 2023, resulting in an effective tax rate of 21.6 percent). In the first nine months of 2024, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of $145 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 10.5 percent ($253 million in the first nine months of 2023, resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.1 percent).
The third quarter of 2023 was favorably impacted by a change in reinvestment assertion on a foreign jurisdiction and an increase in tax credits available to the Company. In the first nine months of 2024, the Company recorded a tax credit of $194 million related to a reassessment of interest and penalties on a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate. The provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2023 was primarily impacted by the geographic mix of earnings, which resulted in a higher effective tax rate.

At September 30, 2024, the Company had a negative investment balance in Sadara Chemical Company of $420 million included in "Other noncurrent obligations" (negative $128 million at December 31, 2023) in the consolidated balance sheets. The negative investment in Sadara Chemical Company at September 30, 2024 is due to equity losses generated during the first nine months of 2024 driven by the impact of challenging macroeconomic conditions.
At September 30, 2024, the Company had a negative investment balance in EQUATE Petrochemical Company K.S.C.C of $68 million included in "Other noncurrent obligations" (negative $101 million at December 31, 2023) in the consolidated balance sheets. The reduction in the negative investment was driven by improved results in the first nine months of 2024.

Debt Covenants and Default Provisions

There were no material changes to the debt covenants and default provisions related to the Company's outstanding long-term debt and primary, private credit agreements in the first nine months of 2024. For additional information on the Company's debt covenants and default provisions, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K.

NOTE 13 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

A summary of the Company's commitments and contingencies can be found in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K, which is incorporated by reference herein.

Environmental Matters

Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based on current law and existing technologies. At September 30, 2024, the Company had accrued obligations of $1,157 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs ($1,180 million at December 31, 2023), including $240 million for the remediation of Superfund sites ($241 million at December 31, 2023). This is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies for handling site remediation and restoration. As new or additional information becomes available and/or certain spending trends become known, management will evaluate such information in determination of the current estimate of environmental liability.

Litigation


Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation

Each quarter, Union Carbide reviews asbestos-related claims filed, settled and dismissed, as well as average settlement and resolution costs by disease category. Union Carbide also considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as the nature of pending claims, trial experience of Union Carbide and other asbestos defendants, current spending for defense and processing costs, significant appellate rulings and legislative developments, trends in the tort system, and their respective effects on expected future resolution costs. Union Carbide's management considers these factors in conjunction with the most recent actuarial study and determines whether a change in the estimate is warranted. Based on Union Carbide's review of 2024 activity, it was determined that no adjustment to the accrual was required at September 30, 2024.
Union Carbide’s total asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims and defense and processing costs was $807 million at September 30, 2024 ($867 million at December 31, 2023). At September 30, 2024, approximately 23 percent of the recorded claim liability related to pending claims and approximately 77 percent related to future claims.

Legacy Matters

The Company is the subject of various complaints related to alleged groundwater contamination based on decades-old sales and applications of certain agricultural chemical products ("Groundwater Matters"). The costs associated with these Groundwater Matters were previously covered by insurance policies that have since been depleted. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company completed a study of the Groundwater Matters now deemed to be probable and estimable based on the public reporting of sampling data and historical information to develop a reasonable estimate of the cost of pending and future claims. As a result, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $177 million, included in "Cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. At September 30, 2024, the total liability related to such alleged Groundwater Matters settlements was $158 million ($232 million at December 31, 2023), which was included in “Accrued and other current liabilities” and "Other noncurrent obligations" in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company is also the subject of other groundwater contamination complaints, including claims related to 1,4-dioxane. The Company continues to defend itself in this litigation and it has determined that the Company's exposure to liability, if any, is not probable or estimable at September 30, 2024.
Separately, on October 10, 2024, the Company executed a settlement agreement related to arbitration for historical product claims from a divested business. As a result, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $75 million in the third quarter of 2024, which is included in "Cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of income, related to Corporate, and included in "Accrued and other current liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024. This is management's best estimate of the loss for which the Company has accrued a liability, although the amount is subject to further arbitration and it is reasonably possible that the total loss could range up to approximately three times that amount.

Indemnifications with Corning Incorporated

The Company had indemnification assets with Corning Incorporated of $58 million at September 30, 2024 ($100 million at December 31, 2023) related to the 2016 ownership restructure of Dow Silicones, which were included in "Other current assets" and "Noncurrent receivables" in the consolidated balance sheets.

Gain Contingency - Dow v. Nova Chemicals Corporation Ethylene Asset Matter

As a result of a 2019 damages judgment related to the ethylene asset matter, Nova Chemicals Corporation was ordered to pay the Company $1.43 billion Canadian dollars (equivalent to approximately $1.08 billion U.S. dollars), for which the Company received payment in October 2019 and March 2020. At September 30, 2024, $201 million ($201 million at December 31, 2023) was included in "Other noncurrent obligations" in the Company's consolidated balance sheets related to the disputed portion of the damages judgment.

Purchase Commitments

In the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a commitment for the use of a reservoir asset that will be used to supply water to one of Dow’s main U.S. Gulf Coast manufacturing locations. The related contract is expected to become effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, with a 35 year contract period expected to commence in 2028 upon completion of construction. The aggregate value of the fixed and determinable portion over the expected contract period is $1.3 billion (approximately $650 million on a present value basis) at September 30, 2024.

Guarantees

The following table provides a summary of the final expiration, maximum future payments and recorded liability included in the consolidated balance sheets for guarantees:

|    |             |                 |                          |                    |                 |                          |                    |      |    |       |    |     |

1.In addition, TDCC has provided guarantees, in proportion to the Company's 35 percent ownership interest, of all future interest payments that will become due on Sadara’s project financing debt during the grace period, which Dow's share is estimated to be $232 million at September 30, 2024 ($298 million at December 31, 2023). The Company does not expect to be required to perform under the guarantees.
Guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, accounts receivable facilities and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others (via delivery of cash or other assets) if specified triggering events occur. With guarantees, such as commercial or financial contracts, non-performance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation of the Company to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee. The majority of the Company’s guarantees relate to debt of nonconsolidated affiliates, which have expiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 14 years. The Company’s current expectation is that future payment or performance related to the non-performance of others is considered remote.
The Company maintains accounts receivable facilities with various financial institutions, with committed and uncommitted facilities in the United States and a committed facility in Europe. Under the terms of the Programs, the Company continues to service the receivables from the customers, but retains no interest in the receivables, and remits payment to the financial institutions. The Company also has access to accounts receivable discounting facilities, under which receivables are transferred with limited recourse. The Company’s maximum guaranteed liability for the accounts receivable facilities is $123 million at September 30, 2024 ($150 million at December 31, 2023). The Company expects receivable collections and remittances to occur within the next six months.
TDCC has entered into guarantee agreements related to Sadara, a nonconsolidated affiliate. Sadara reached an agreement with its lenders to re-profile its outstanding project financing debt in the first quarter of 2021. In conjunction with the debt re-profiling, TDCC entered into a guarantee of up to approximately $1.3 billion of Sadara’s debt, proportionate to the Company's 35 percent ownership interest. The debt re-profiling also includes a grace period until June 2026, during which Sadara is obligated to make interest-only payments which are guaranteed by TDCC in proportion to the Company’s 35 percent ownership interest. As part of the debt re-profiling, Sadara established a $500 million revolving credit facility guaranteed by Dow, which would be used to fund Dow’s pro-rata share of any potential shortfall during the grace period.

|    |                                                   |                  |       |              |      |            |          |      |       |       |            |       |          |          |       |          |       |    |       |    |       |    |          |

1.The Company's held-to-maturity securities are primarily treasury bills and time deposits. At September 30, 2024, $66 million is included in "Cash and cash equivalents" ($485 million at December 31, 2023) and $39 million is included in "Other current assets" (zero at December 31, 2023) in the consolidated balance sheets.
2.The Company’s investments in marketable securities are included in “Other current assets” in the consolidated balance sheets.
3.Estimated asset for an investment in a limited liability company included in "Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates" in the consolidated balance sheets.
4.The Company’s investments in debt securities, which are primarily available-for-sale, and equity securities are included in “Other investments” in the consolidated balance sheets.
5.U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and other municipalities’ obligations.
6.Equity securities with a readily determinable fair value.
7.See Note 19 for classification of derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets.
8.Cost includes fair value hedge adjustment gains of $70 million at September 30, 2024 and $49 million at December 31, 2023 on $5,129 million of debt at September 30, 2024 and $4,479 million at December 31, 2023.
9.Estimated liability for TDCC's guarantee of Sadara's debt which is included in "Other noncurrent obligations" in the consolidated balance sheets.
Cost approximates fair value for all other financial instruments.
For equity securities calculated at net asset value per share (or its equivalent), the Company had $90 million in private market securities and $16 million in real estate at September 30, 2024 ($86 million in private market securities and $18 million in real estate at December 31, 2023). There are no redemption restrictions and the unfunded commitments on these investments were $84 million at September 30, 2024 and $75 million at December 31, 2023.
For assets classified as Level 3 measurements, fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs including assumptions where there is little, if any, market activity. The level 3 asset values represent the fair value of an investment in a corporate bond, accounted for as a debt security. At December 31, 2023, the level 3 asset values also included an investment in a limited liability company, accounted for as an investment in nonconsolidated affiliates, and with no unfunded commitment.
For liabilities classified as Level 3 measurements, fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs including assumptions where there is little, if any, market activity. The fair value of the Company’s accrued liability related to the guarantee of Sadara’s debt is in proportion to the Company’s 35 percent ownership interest in Sadara. The estimated fair value of the guarantee was calculated using a "with" and "without" method. The fair value of the debt was calculated "with" the guarantee less the fair value of the debt "without" the guarantee. The "with" and "without" values were calculated using a discounted cash flow method based on contractual cash flows as well as projected prepayments made on the debt by Sadara.

NOTE 21 – SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS

Dow’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is Operating EBIT as this is the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker assesses performance and allocates resources.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales ("COS") was $9.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024, compared with $9.6 billion in the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, COS was $28.9 billion compared with $30.1 billion in the first nine months of 2023. COS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased on higher volume and a charge related to an arbitration settlement agreement for historical product claims from a divested business, and was partially offset by lower global energy and feedstock costs. COS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to lower raw material costs, lower global energy and feedstock costs and the impact of structural cost improvements, partially offset by increased planned maintenance turnaround spending and a charge related to an arbitration settlement agreement for historical product claims from a divested business. COS as a percentage of net sales was 90.2 percent in the third quarter of 2024 (89.4 percent in the third quarter of 2023) and 88.7 percent for the first nine months of 2024 (88.5 percent for the first nine months of 2023).

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development ("R&D") expenses totaled $208 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with $197 million in the third quarter of 2023. R&D expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were $608 million compared with $616 million in the first nine months of 2023. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses totaled $396 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with $380 million in the third quarter of 2023. SG&A expenses increased in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher bad debt expense and performance-based compensation costs. For the first nine months of 2024, SG&A expenses were $1,228 million, compared with $1,216 million in the first nine months of 2023. SG&A expenses for the first nine months of 2024 increased primarily due to higher bad debt expense, including expense incurred as a result of a resolution of a dispute with a customer, which was partially offset by the impact of structural cost improvements.

Amortization of Intangibles

Amortization of intangibles was $76 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with $81 million in the third quarter of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, amortization of intangibles was $234 million, compared with $243 million in the first nine months of 2023.

Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Nonconsolidated Affiliates

The Company's share of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates was $2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with equity in losses of nonconsolidated affiliates of $7 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $9 million, primarily due to improved performance at the Kuwait joint ventures and slightly offset by lower results at the Sadara and Thai joint ventures. The Company's share of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates was $45 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared with equity in losses of nonconsolidated affiliates of $112 million for the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to improved performance at the Kuwait and Sadara joint ventures and slightly offset by lower results at the Thai joint ventures. Cash dividends from nonconsolidated 
affiliates were $266 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with $188 million in the first nine months of 2023.

Sundry Income (Expense) – Net

Sundry income (expense) - net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was income of $119 million and $118 million for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively, compared with income of $92 million and $71 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in sundry income is primarily due to higher gains on the sales of assets and investments and lower foreign currency exchange losses, which were partially offset by a decrease in non-operating pension and postretirement benefit plan credits.
Sundry income (expense) - net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was income of $256 million and $253 million for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively, compared with income of $202 million and $169 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in sundry income is primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange losses and higher gains on the sales of assets and investments, which were partially offset by a decrease in non-operating pension and postretirement benefit plan credits.

Interest Expense and Amortization of Debt Discount

Interest expense and amortization of debt discount was $199 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with $192 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest expense and amortization of debt discount was $595 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with $549 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to borrowings outside of the United States and $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in the first quarter of 2024.

Provision for Income Taxes

The Company's effective tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, where income is earned, the level of income relative to tax attributes and the level of equity earnings, since most earnings from the Company's equity method investments are taxed at the joint venture level. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of $84 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.9 percent and 25.1 percent for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of $90 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 21.6 percent and 22.5 percent for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively. For the first nine months of 2024, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of $145 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 10.5 percent and 10.4 percent for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively. For the first nine months of 2023, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of $253 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.1 percent and 25.7 percent for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's income taxes and effective tax rates.
The Company continues to monitor and evaluate legislative developments related to the Global Anti-Base Erosion Proposal Regime ("GloBE") established by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development’s ("OECD") Pillar Two framework. Several countries in which the Company operates have adopted GloBE into their legislation and several others are expected to enact these rules in the future. To date, such legislation has not materially impacted the Company's effective tax rate.

For each of its foreign subsidiaries, Dow makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States.
Cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. Dow has the ability to repatriate additional funds to the United States, which could result in an adjustment to the tax liability for foreign withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes and the impact of foreign currency movements. At September 30, 2024, management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the United States. The Company has and expects to continue repatriating certain funds from its non‑U.S. subsidiaries that are not needed to finance local operations; however, these particular repatriation activities have not and are not expected to result in a significant incremental tax liability to the Company.
The Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Cash used for investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of investments, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. In addition, cash used for investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 included the acquisition of Circulus Holdings, PBLLC, a U.S. mechanical recycling company.
The Company's capital expenditures were $2,173 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with $1,598 million in the first nine months of 2023. The Company expects full year capital spending in 2024 to be approximately $3 billion, which includes the ramp up of the construction of the Fort Saskatchewan Path2Zero project aligned to the Company's Decarbonize & Grow strategy. The Company expects capital spending for this key growth project to average approximately $1 billion annually through 2029. Enterprise-wide capital spending is expected to exceed depreciation and amortization through 2027, during the first phase of the project, and average depreciation and amortization over the economic cycle. As evidenced across prior economic cycles, the Company will adjust its spending as economic conditions evolve.

Dow Inc. Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures


Free Cash Flow 

Dow defines Free Cash Flow as "Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations," less capital expenditures. Under this definition, Free Cash Flow represents the cash generated by Dow from operations after investing in its asset base. Free Cash Flow, combined with cash balances and other sources of liquidity, represents the cash available to fund obligations and provide returns to shareholders. Free Cash Flow is an integral financial measure used in the Company's financial planning process.
Operating EBITDA
Dow defines Operating EBITDA as earnings (i.e., "Income before income taxes") before interest, depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact of significant items.

Cash Flow Conversion (Cash Flow from Operations to Operating EBITDA)

Dow defines Cash Flow Conversion (Cash Flow from Operations to Operating EBITDA) as "Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations," divided by Operating EBITDA. Management believes Cash Flow Conversion is an important financial metric as it helps the Company determine how efficiently it is converting its earnings into cash flow.
These financial measures are not recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP financial measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, Dow's definitions may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies.

Liquidity & Financial Flexibility

The Company’s primary source of incremental liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. The generation of cash from operations and the Company's ability to access capital markets is expected to meet the Company’s cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, debt maturities, contributions to pension plans, dividend distributions to stockholders, share repurchases and other needs. In addition to cash from operating activities, the Company’s current liquidity sources also include TDCC's U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, committed accounts receivable facilities, a medium-term notes program, a U.S. retail note program (“InterNotes®”) and other debt markets.
The Company continues to maintain a strong financial position with all of its committed credit facilities undrawn and fully available at September 30, 2024. Cash and committed and available forms of liquidity were $12.7 billion at September 30, 2024. The Company also has no substantive long-term debt maturities due until 2027. As a well-known seasoned issuer, the Company may issue debt at any time as an additional source of liquidity. Additional details on sources of liquidity are as follows:

Commercial Paper

TDCC issues promissory notes under its U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs. TDCC had no commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2024. TDCC maintains access to the commercial paper market at competitive rates. Amounts outstanding under TDCC's commercial paper programs during the period may be greater or less than the amount reported at the end of the period. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, TDCC issued approximately $700 million of commercial paper.

Committed Credit Facilities

The Company also has the ability to access liquidity through TDCC's committed and available credit facilities. At September 30, 2024, TDCC had total committed and available credit facilities of $8.4 billion. 

Uncommitted Credit Facilities

The Company has entered into various uncommitted bilateral credit arrangements as a potential source of excess liquidity. These lines can be used to support short-term liquidity needs and for general purposes. The Company had no drawdowns outstanding at September 30, 2024.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities

In addition to the above credit facilities, the Company maintains a committed accounts receivable facility in the United States where eligible trade accounts receivable, up to $900 million, may be sold at any point in time. The Company also maintains a committed accounts receivable facility in Europe where eligible trade accounts receivable, up to €500 million, may be sold at any point in time. In the first nine months of 2024, there were $289 million in sales of receivables under the U.S. and Europe committed accounts receivable facilities ($28 million in sales of receivables in the first nine months of 2023). At September 30, 2024, approximately $26 million of sold receivables were outstanding. 
In addition, the Company has an uncommitted accounts receivable facility in the United States providing additional liquidity. Sales of receivables under this facility were $378 million in the first nine months of 2024 (no sales of receivables in the first nine months of 2023). At September 30, 2024, approximately $19 million of sold receivables were outstanding. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Early Settlement of Letters of Credit

The Company utilizes, from time-to-time, letters of credit discounting programs to manage and expedite the settlement of letters of credit in certain regions. These letters of credit are associated with accounts receivable and the Company retains no interest in the transferred letters of credit or receivables once sold.

Accounts Receivable Discounting Facilities

The Company has access to accounts receivable discounting facilities, under which receivables are transferred with limited recourse. The Company retains no interest in the transferred receivables once sold. Sales of receivables under this facility were $581 million in the first nine months of 2024 (no sales of receivables in the first nine months of 2023). At September 30, 2024, approximately $154 million of sold receivables were outstanding. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The Company maintains these facilities and also participates in certain customers’ supply chain financing and other early pay programs as a routine source of working capital. 

Company-Owned Life Insurance

The Company has investments in company-owned life insurance ("COLI") policies, which are recorded at their cash surrender value as of each balance sheet date. The Company has the ability to monetize its investment in its COLI policies as an additional source of liquidity. At September 30, 2024, the Company had monetized $260 million of its existing COLI policies' surrender value ($97 million at December 31, 2023). See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Debt

As the Company continues to maintain its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, management is focused on net debt (a non-GAAP financial measure), as the Company believes this is the best representation of its financial leverage at this point in time. As shown in the following table, net debt is equal to total gross debt minus "Cash and cash equivalents" and "Marketable securities."

1.Included in "Other current assets" in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company may at any time repurchase certain debt securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to: the applicable terms under which any such debt securities were issued, certain internal approvals of the Company, and applicable laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction in which any such potential transactions might take place. This in no way obligates the Company to make any such repurchases nor should it be considered an offer to do so.
TDCC's public debt instruments and primary, private credit agreements contain, among other provisions, certain customary restrictive covenant and default provisions. TDCC's most significant debt covenant with regard to its financial position is the obligation to maintain the ratio of its consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization at no greater than 0.70 to 1.00 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under the Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement ("Revolving Credit Agreement") equals or exceeds $500 million. The ratio of TDCC's consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement was 0.44 to 1.00 at September 30, 2024. Management believes TDCC was in compliance with all of its covenants and default provisions at September 30, 2024. For information on TDCC's debt covenants and default provisions, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K. There were no material changes to the debt covenants and default provisions related to TDCC’s outstanding long-term debt and primary, private credit agreements in the first nine months of 2024.
In the first quarter of 2024, the Company issued $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes. The offering included $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.15 percent notes due 2034 and $650 million aggregate principal amount of 5.60 percent notes due 2054. The issuance was completed under the Company's Green Finance Framework, which is available on the Company's website. The Company will distribute the proceeds toward projects that support the execution of its sustainability strategy and achieve its targets focused on climate protection and a circular economy, including applicable expenditures and investments related to the Company's Fort Saskatchewan Path2Zero project, which is expected to deliver organic growth while decarbonizing 20 percent of the Company’s global ethylene capacity. 
In the second quarter of 2024, the Company redeemed $10 million aggregate principal amount of 2.10 percent notes due November 2030, $30 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25 percent notes due October 2034, $8 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25 percent notes due November 2041 and $12 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375 percent notes due November 2042. As a result of the redemption, the Company recognized a pretax gain on the early extinguishment of debt of $5 million, included in "Sundry income (expense) - net" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Corporate.
In the first nine months of 2024, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount of $71 million of InterNotes®. The Company also issued $122 million of foreign currency loans. Additionally, the Company repaid $77 million of long-term debt. 
While taking into consideration the current economic environment, management expects that the Company will continue to have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet all of its business obligations.

Credit Ratings

At September 30, 2024, TDCC's credit ratings were as follows:

|    |                   |                  |                   |         |

|  4 | Standard & Poor’s | BBB              | A-2               | Stable  |

On July 1, 2024, Fitch Ratings affirmed TDCC's BBB+ and F1 rating, and affirmed its outlook of stable. On July 1, 2024, Standard & Poor's also affirmed TDCC's BBB and A-2 rating, and affirmed its outlook of stable. On August 6, 2024, Moody's Ratings affirmed TDCC's Baa1 and P-2 rating, and affirmed its outlook of stable. These credit agencies' decisions were made as part of their annual review process and reflect the Company's supportive financial policies, scale, liquidity and cost-advantaged footprint. 

Dividends


Dow Inc.

Dow Inc. has paid dividends on a quarterly basis since the separation from DowDuPont and expects to continue to do so, subject to approval by the Dow Inc. Board. Dividends declared by the Board align to the Company's strategy announced in 2018 of returning approximately 45 percent of Operating Net Income to shareholders through dividends and total shareholder remuneration of approximately 65 percent, when including share repurchases, over the economic cycle. The Company defines Operating Net Income, a non-GAAP measure, as "Net income available for Dow Inc. common stockholders," excluding the impact of significant items. The following table summarizes dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of record in 2024:

|    |                                      |                   |                    |                    |      |

TDCC

TDCC has committed to fund Dow Inc.'s dividends paid to common stockholders and share repurchases, as approved by the Dow Inc. Board, as well as certain governance expenses. Funding is accomplished through intercompany loans. TDCC's Board reviews and determines a dividend distribution to Dow Inc. to settle the intercompany loans. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, TDCC declared and paid a dividend of $600 million to Dow Inc. ($2,077 million of dividend declared and $1,984 million of dividend paid to Dow Inc. for the nine months ended September 30, 2024). At September 30, 2024, TDCC's intercompany loan balance with Dow Inc. was insignificant.

Share Repurchase Program

On April 13, 2022, the Dow Inc. Board approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $3 billion for the repurchase of the Company's common stock, with no expiration date. The Company repurchased $94 million of its common stock in the third quarter of 2024 ($494 million in the first nine months of 2024). At September 30, 2024, approximately $931 million of the share repurchase program authorization remained available for repurchases. As previously announced, the Company intends to repurchase shares at a minimum to cover dilution over the cycle. The Company may from time to time expand its share repurchases beyond dilution, based on a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions, free cash flow generation, and the Dow share price. Any share repurchases, when coupled with the Company's dividends, are intended to implement the long-term strategy of targeting shareholder remuneration of approximately 65 percent over the economic cycle.

Pension Plans

The Company has both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover employees in the United States and a number of other countries. The Company's funding policy is to contribute to funded plans when pension laws and/or economics either require or encourage funding. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company received a pension asset reversion of approximately $70 million (approximately $90 million in the second quarter of 2023) for a portion of the excess funding of one of its plans in Europe. These plan asset reversions are included in "Other assets and liabilities, net" in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
As announced in 2021, all U.S. pension plans were frozen for substantially all employees who participated in the U.S. defined benefit pension programs effective December 31, 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company spun off a portion of each of the Company’s two existing tax-qualified U.S defined benefit pension plans into two new tax-qualified pension plans, which includes the tax-qualified benefit obligations for substantially all employees hired after January 1, 2008. These employees earned benefits based on a set percentage of annual pay, plus interest, and the spin of these plans provide the Company the ability to separately manage the assets and obligations of these plans with like benefits. In the second quarter of 2024, as part of its ongoing pension de-risking initiatives, the Company initiated the termination of the two new tax-qualified pension plans. As part of the plan termination process, the Company will offer participants of these plans annuity or lump sum distribution options. Final asset distributions are expected to be paid from plan assets in the fourth quarter of 2025, with minimal additional funding, if any, required from the Company, and are anticipated to result in pension settlement charges, with the amounts dependent on various factors, including interest rates, plan asset returns, annuity pricing and participant distribution elections.

See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K for additional information related to the Company's pension plans.


Restructuring

The actions related to the 2023 Restructuring Program are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of $60 million, primarily through the first quarter of 2025, and consist of severance and related benefit costs. Restructuring implementation costs, primarily decommissioning and demolition activities related to asset actions, and costs associated with the Company's productivity and efficiency actions, are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of approximately $90 million, primarily through the first quarter of 2025. Restructuring implementation and efficiency costs totaled $55 million and $157 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.
The Company expects to incur additional costs in the future related to its restructuring activities, which will be recognized as incurred. The Company also expects to incur additional employee-related costs, including involuntary termination benefits related to its other optimization activities. These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's restructuring activities.

Contractual Obligations

Information related to the Company’s contractual obligations, commercial commitments and expected cash requirements for interest can be found in Notes 13, 14, 15 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K. With the exception of the items noted below, there have been no material changes in the Company’s contractual obligations since December 31, 2023.

OTHER MATTERS


Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s critical accounting policies that are impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates are described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 10-K. Since December 31, 2023, there have been no material changes in the Company’s accounting policies that are impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates.

Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation

Union Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos‑containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide’s premises, and Union Carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. (“Amchem”). In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to Union Carbide’s products.
The table below provides information regarding asbestos-related claims pending against Union Carbide and Amchem based on criteria developed by Union Carbide and its external consultants:

|    |                                                             |         |      |         |

Plaintiffs’ lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants. As a result, the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to Union Carbide, Amchem or any other particular defendant, even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury. For these reasons and based upon Union Carbide’s litigation and settlement experience, Union Carbide does not consider the damages alleged against Union Carbide and Amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos-related liability.

For additional information, see Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings; and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K.

Environmental Proceedings

On December 16, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint and proposed consent decree on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") relating to environmental contamination at the Lower Passaic River Study Area Superfund Site in New Jersey.
