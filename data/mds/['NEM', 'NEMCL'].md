____________________________
(1)Attributable gold ounces produced includes 66 and 52 thousand ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 173 and 163 thousand ounces for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the Pueblo Viejo mine, which is 40% owned by Newmont and accounted for as an equity method investment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Attributable gold ounces produced also includes 43 thousand ounces and 99 thousand ounces, respectively, related to the Fruta del Norte mine, which is wholly owned by Lundin Gold, in which the Company holds a 31.9% interest at September 30, 2024 and is accounted for as an equity method investment on a quarter lag.
(2)Attributable gold ounces sold excludes ounces related to the Pueblo Viejo mine and the Fruta del Norte mine.
(3)Gold equivalent ounces are calculated as pounds or ounces produced or sold multiplied by the ratio of the other metals’ price to the gold price. Refer to Results of Consolidated Operations within Part I, Item 2, MD&A for further information.
(4)On June 7, 2023, the Company suspended its operations at Peñasquito due to the Union strike. As a result of the suspended operations, no production occurred during the third quarter of 2023. Sales activity recognized in the third quarter of 2023 is related to adjustments on provisionally priced concentrate sales subject to final settlement. Consequently, price per ounce/pound metrics are not meaningful ("N.M."). 

(5)Excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation.


(6)Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures within Part I, Item 2, MD&A.

Third Quarter 2024 Highlights (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts, unless otherwise noted)
•Net income: Reported Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders of $873 or $0.76 per diluted share, an increase of $716 from the prior-year quarter primarily due to an increase to attributable net income related to the acquired Newcrest sites. Excluding the impact of acquired sites, the increase is primarily due to an increase in Sales at Peñasquito as a result of the work stoppage due to a labor strike that began in June 2023 ("Peñasquito labor strike"), resulting in no sales at Peñasquito in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders increased due to higher average realized prices primarily for gold. This increase was partially offset by the Loss on assets held for sale of $115 and higher Costs applicable to sales.
•Adjusted net income: Reported Adjusted net income of $936 or $0.81 per diluted share, an increase of $0.45 per diluted share from the prior-year quarter (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures within Part I, Item 2, MD&A).

•Adjusted EBITDA: Reported $1,967 in Adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 111% from the prior-year quarter (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures within Part I, Item 2, MD&A).

•Cash flow: Reported Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of $3,807 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 78% from the prior year, and free cash flow of $1,280 (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures within Part I, Item 2, MD&A).
•Portfolio Updates: Completed the sale of the Batu and Elang contingent consideration assets for cash consideration of $153, which was received in September 2024. Announced agreement to sell the assets of the Telfer reportable segment, including Newmont’s 70% interest in the Havieron development project and other related assets; the sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. In October, announced agreement to sell the Akyem reportable segment; the sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024.
•Attributable gold production: Produced 1.7 million attributable ounces of gold and 430 thousand attributable gold equivalent ounces from co-products.
•Financial strength: Ended the quarter with $3.0 billion of consolidated cash, cash of $86 included in Assets held for sale, and $7.1 billion of total liquidity; redeemed $150 of senior notes; settled $347 of share repurchases from $1 billion share repurchase program. In October, declared a dividend of $0.25 per share and the Company's Board authorized an additional $2 billion share repurchase program to be executed at the Company’s discretion, utilizing open market repurchases to occur from time to time throughout the next 24 months.

In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of these interim statements have been included. The results reported in these interim statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be reported for the entire year. These interim statements should be read in conjunction with Newmont’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 on Form 10-K. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements and, in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q, certain information and footnote disclosures required by GAAP have been condensed or omitted.

Divestment of Non-Core Assets


Telfer

In September 2024, the Company entered into a binding agreement to sell the assets of the Telfer reportable segment to Greatland Gold plc. The sale, which is subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals, is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company recorded a loss on assets held for sale of $115 during the quarter, which is subject to change upon completion of the transaction, and is currently evaluating other potential impacts of the terms of the agreement on its consolidated financial statements. The Telfer assets and liabilities remain designated as held for sale as of September 30, 2024.

Akyem

In October 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Akyem reportable segment to Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. The sale, which is subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals, is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company does not expect to record a loss on the completion of the transaction and is currently evaluating other potential impacts of the terms of the agreement on its consolidated financial statements. The Akyem assets and liabilities remain designated as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. 

Refer to Note 5 for further information on the Company's assets and liabilities held for sale.


Newcrest Transaction

On November 6, 2023, the Company completed its business combination transaction with Newcrest Mining Limited, a public Australian mining company limited by shares ("Newcrest"), whereby Newmont, through Newmont Overseas Holdings Pty Ltd, an Australian proprietary company limited by shares (“Newmont Sub”), acquired all of the ordinary shares of Newcrest in a fully stock transaction for total non-cash consideration of $13,549. Newcrest became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Sub and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont (such acquisition, the “Newcrest transaction”). The combined company continues to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker NEM. The combined company is also listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker NGT, on the Australian Securities Exchange under the ticker NEM, and on the Papua New Guinea Securities Exchange under the ticker NEM. Refer to Note 3 for further information.

Noncontrolling Interests

Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest is comprised of income of $2 and $5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and of $15 and $17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to Suriname Gold project C.V. (“Merian”). Newmont consolidates Merian through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Newmont Suriname LLC., in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as the primary beneficiary of Merian, which is a variable interest entity.

Discontinued Operations

Net income (loss) from discontinued operations includes results related to the Batu Hijau and Elang contingent consideration assets associated with the sale of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara in 2016. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed the sale of the Batu and Elang contingent consideration assets for cash consideration of $153, resulting in a gain of $15 included in Net income (loss) from discontinued operations. Refer to Note 12 for further information.

NOTE 2     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


Risks and Uncertainties

As a global mining company, the Company’s revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing metal prices, primarily for gold, but also for copper, silver, lead, and zinc. Historically, the commodity markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that commodity prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, 

NEWMONT CORPORATION


NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(unaudited, dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

cash flows, access to capital and on the quantities of reserves that the Company can economically produce. The carrying value of the Company’s Property, plant and mine development, net; Inventories; Stockpiles and ore on leach pads; Investments; certain Derivative assets; Deferred income tax assets; and Goodwill are particularly sensitive to the outlook for commodity prices. A decline in the Company’s price outlook from current levels could result in material impairment charges related to these assets.
The Company's global operations expose it to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19, and geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Company continues to experience the impacts from recent geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures. With the resulting volatile environment, the Company continues to monitor inflationary conditions, the effects of certain countermeasures taken by central banks, and the potential for further supply chain disruptions as well as an uncertain and evolving labor market. 
The following factors could have further potential short- and, possibly, long-term material adverse impacts on the Company including, but not limited to, volatility in commodity prices and the prices for gold and other metals, changes in the equity and debt markets or country specific factors adversely impacting discount rates, significant cost inflation impacts on production, capital and asset retirement costs, logistical challenges, workforce interruptions and financial market disruptions, energy market disruptions, as well as potential impacts to estimated costs and timing of projects.

Refer to Note 20 below for further information on risks and uncertainties that could have a potential impact on the Company as well as Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. The Company must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information used is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Assets Held for Sale

A long-lived asset (or a disposal group for a long-lived asset comprising a group of assets and related liabilities) is classified as held for sale if it is probable that the asset will be recovered through sale rather than continuing use. 
The Company records assets held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and ceases depreciation and amortization on long-lived assets (or disposal groups). The following criteria are used to determine if a long-lived asset (or disposal group) is held for sale: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
In determining the fair value of the assets less costs to sell, the Company considers factors including current sales prices for comparable assets, discounted cash flow projections, third party valuations and indicative offer information, if applicable. The Company’s assumptions about fair value require significant judgment because the current market is sensitive to changes in economic conditions, as well as asset-specific considerations. The Company estimates the fair value of assets held for sale based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management, which may differ from actual results and could result in future impairments if market conditions deteriorate. 
An impairment loss on the initial classification and subsequent measurement of an asset held for sale is recognized as an expense. Any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell (not exceeding the accumulated impairment loss that has been previously recognized) is recognized as a reversal of expense. The Company continues to evaluate the fair value of assets held for sale and monitors market conditions and other economic factors, which could result in additional impairments in the future.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts and disclosures in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Securities and Exchange Commission Rules


Effects of Reference Rate Reform

In March 2020, ASU No. 2020-04 was issued which provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden on accounting for contract modifications caused by reference rate reform. In January 2021, ASU No. 2021-01 was issued which broadened the scope of ASU No. 2020-04 to include certain derivative instruments. In December 2022, ASU No. 2022-06 was issued which deferred the sunset date of ASU No. 2020-04. The guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through 

NEWMONT CORPORATION


NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(unaudited, dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

December 31, 2024. The guidance may be adopted over time as reference rate reform activities occur and should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company has completed its review of key contracts and does not expect the guidance to have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements or disclosures. The Company will continue to review new contracts to identify references to the LIBOR and implement adequate fallback provisions if not already implemented to mitigate the risks or impacts from the transition.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Securities and Exchange Commission Rules


SEC Final Climate Rule

In March 2024, the SEC issued a final rule that requires registrants to disclose climate-related information in their annual reports and in registration statements. In April 2024, the SEC chose to stay the newly adopted rule pending judicial review of related consolidated Eighth Circuit petitions. If the stay is lifted, certain disclosures may be required in annual reports for the year ending December 31, 2025, filed in 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the rules on its consolidated financial statements.

Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures

In December 2023, ASU 2023-09 was issued which requires disaggregated information about the effective tax rate reconciliation and additional information on taxes paid that meet a qualitative threshold. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

Segments Reporting

In November 2023, ASU 2023-07 was issued which improves disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and addresses requests from investors and other allocators of capital for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. The ASU applies to all public entities that are required to report segment information in accordance with ASC 280 and is effective starting in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

NOTE 3     BUSINESS ACQUISITION

On November 6, 2023 (the “acquisition date”), Newmont completed its business combination transaction with Newcrest, a public Australian mining company limited by shares, whereby Newmont, through Newmont Sub, acquired all of the ordinary shares of Newcrest, pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under Part 5.1 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) between Newcrest and its shareholders, as contemplated by a scheme implementation deed, dated as of May 15, 2023, by and among Newmont, Newmont Sub and Newcrest, as amended from time to time. Upon implementation, Newmont completed the business acquisition of Newcrest, in which Newmont was the acquirer and Newcrest became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Sub and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont (such acquisition, the “Newcrest transaction”). The acquisition of Newcrest increased the Company’s gold and other metal reserves and expanded the operating jurisdictions.
The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred consisted of the following:

|    |                                                                      |             |           |    |                        |        |    |        |
|---:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|:----------|:---|:-----------------------|:-------|:---|:-------|
|  1 | (in millions, except share and per share data)                       | Shares      | Per Share |    | Purchase Consideration |        |    |        |
|  2 | Stock Consideration                                                  |             |           |    |                        |        |    |        |
|  3 | Shares of Newmont exchanged for Newcrest outstanding ordinary shares | 357,691,627 |           | $  | 37.88                  |        | $  | 13,549 |
|  5 | Total Purchase Price                                                 |             |           |    | $                      | 13,549 |    |        |

The Company retained an independent appraiser to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price of Newcrest has been allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated acquisition date fair values. The fair value estimates were based on income, market and cost valuation methods. The excess of the total consideration over the estimated fair value of the amounts initially assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill balance is mainly attributable to: (i) the acquisition of existing operating mines with access to an assembled workforce that cannot be duplicated at the same costs by new entrants; (ii) operating synergies anticipated from the integration of the operations of Newmont and Newcrest; and (iii) the application of Newmont’s Full Potential program and potential strategic and financial benefits that include the increase in reserve base and opportunities to identify additional mineralization through exploration activities.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not yet fully completed the analysis to assign fair values to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and therefore the purchase price allocation for Newcrest is preliminary. At September 30, 2024, remaining items to finalize include the fair value of materials and supplies inventories, property, plant and mine development, goodwill, reclamation and remediation liabilities, employee-related benefits, unrecognized tax benefits, and deferred income tax assets and

liabilities. The preliminary purchase price allocation will be subject to further refinement as the Company continues to implement Newmont accounting policies and refine its estimates and assumptions based on information available at the acquisition date. These refinements may result in material changes to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase price allocation adjustments can be made throughout Newmont’s measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.
The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation for the Newcrest transaction at September 30, 2024:
|    |                                               |                       |        |

____________________________
(1)During 2024, measurement period adjustments totaling $405 increased Property, plant and mine development, net, from refinements to the preliminary valuation of the Canadian and Telfer assets. 
(2)Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax benefit or future tax expense associated with the differences between the preliminary fair value allocated to assets (excluding goodwill) and liabilities and a tax basis increase to the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired in Australia and the historical carryover tax basis of assets and liabilities in all other jurisdictions. No deferred tax liability is recognized for the basis difference inherent in the preliminary fair value allocated to goodwill. During 2024, adjustments resulted in deferred income tax assets increasing by a total of $50 and deferred income tax liabilities increasing by a total of $98. 
(3)Preliminary goodwill is attributable to reportable segments as follows: $1,088 to Brucejack; $404 to Red Chris; $356 to Cadia; and $615 to Lihir. During 2024, the Company identified and recorded measurement period adjustments to the Company's preliminary purchase price allocation, as a result of additional analysis performed. These adjustments resulted in a total reduction in Goodwill of $281.
(4)During 2024, measurement period adjustments of $67 increased Reclamation and remediation liabilities from refinements to the preliminary valuation of the Telfer asset.

Sales and Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations includes Newcrest revenue of $1,160 and $3,292 and Newcrest net income (loss) of $145 and $621 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

NOTE 4     SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company regularly reviews its segment reporting for alignment with its strategic goals and operational structure as well as for evaluation of business performance and allocation of resources by Newmont’s Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"). The reportable segments of the Company comprise each of its 17 mining operations that it manages, which includes its 70.0% proportionate interest in Red Chris, and its 38.5% proportionate interest in Nevada Gold Mines ("NGM") which it does not directly manage. 
In the following tables, Income (loss) before income and mining tax and other items from reportable segments does not reflect general corporate expenses, interest (except project-specific interest) or income and mining taxes. Intercompany revenue and expense amounts have been eliminated within each segment in order to report on the basis that management uses internally for evaluating segment performance. The Company's business activities and operating segments that are not considered reportable, including all equity method investments, are reported in Corporate and Other, which has been provided for reconciliation purposes.
The financial information relating to the Company’s segments is as follows:

NOTE 5    ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE

Based on a comprehensive review of the Company’s portfolio of assets, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a portfolio optimization program to divest six non-core assets and a development project in February 2024. The non-core assets to be divested include the CC&V, Musselwhite, Porcupine, Éléonore, Telfer, and Akyem reportable segments, and the Coffee development project which is included within Corporate and Other. The Telfer disposal group also includes the Havieron development project, which is 70% owned by the Company and accounted for under proportionate consolidation, and other related assets.
In February 2024, based on progress made through the Company's active sales program and management’s expectation that the sale is probable and will be completed within 12 months, the Company concluded that these non-core assets and the development project met the accounting requirements to be presented as held for sale. While the Company remains committed to a plan to sell these assets for a fair price, there is a possibility that the assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond the Company's control. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate net book value of the non-core assets and the development project was $3,419.
Upon meeting the requirements to be presented as held for sale, the six non-core assets and the development project were recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell, and will be periodically valued until sale occurs. As a result, a total loss of $115 and $846 was recognized within Loss on assets held for sale for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the loss is comprised of write-downs of $115 and $624, respectively, and a tax impact resulting in the establishment of a deferred tax asset which increased the respective carrying values and resulted in an additional loss of $— and $222, respectively. The write-down resulted in an aggregate net book value of $2,990 at September 30, 2024.

(unaudited, dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

The estimated fair values were determined using the income approach in the absence of a binding sales agreement and are considered non-recurring level 3 fair value measurements. For fair values estimated using the income approach, the significant inputs included (i) cash flow information available to the Company, (ii) a short-term gold price of $2,575 per ounce, (iii) a long-term gold price of $1,700 per ounce, (iv) current estimates of reserves, resources, and exploration potential, and (v) a reporting unit specific discount rate in the range of 6.0% to 12.0%. The Telfer fair value measurement was based on the binding agreement announced in the third quarter of 2024 and is considered a non-recurring level 3 measurement based on the form of consideration which includes certain unobservable inputs. The Company will continue to monitor its estimates of the fair value of assets held for sale, which could result in additional future impairments based on unfavorable market conditions or other economic factors. 
The following table presents the carrying value of the major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale by disposal group as of September 30, 2024, prior to recognition of the write-down of $624, excluding tax impacts, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

NOTE 7     RECLAMATION AND REMEDIATION

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations to protect public health and the environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation and remediation costs are based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements.

____________________________

(1)The Newcrest transaction occurred on November 6, 2023, resulting in an increase in the beginning balance at January 1, 2024, as compared to the beginning balance at January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 3 for further information.

(2)The $75 addition to reclamation for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increased labor and post-closure maintenance costs, and higher estimated costs arising from recent tailings management review and monitoring requirements set forth by GISTM at non-operating portions of the Porcupine site operation, and higher estimated closure costs at NGM due to GISTM compliance at Phoenix. 
(3)The $28 addition to remediation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the completion of haul road safety enhancements and continued clean up of contaminated materials and closure of the three mine portals at the Ross Adams mine. The $45 addition to remediation for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to higher water management costs and project execution delays at the Midnite Mine.
(4)During 2024, measurement period adjustments of $64 increased Reclamation and remediation liabilities from refinements to the preliminary valuation of the Telfer asset.
(5)During the first quarter of 2024, certain non-core assets were determined to meet the criteria for assets held for sale. As a result, the related assets and liabilities, including Reclamation and remediation liabilities, were reclassified to Assets held for sale and Liabilities held for sale, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional information.

(1)All assets held for sale, with the exception of Telfer, were valued using an income-based approach; refer to Note 5 for information on the assumptions and inputs specific to the non-recurring fair value measurements performed. As a binding agreement was reached for Telfer in the third quarter of 2024, the terms of the agreement were utilized to estimate the fair value of the Telfer assets held for sale at September 30, 2024.

(2)The SCFA and the Cadia Power Purchase Agreement ("Cadia PPA"), acquired as part of the Newcrest transaction, were not designated in a hedging relationship at December 31, 2023. At January 1, 2024, the Company designated the Cadia PPA for hedge accounting, and as a result is included within Hedging instruments at September 30, 2024. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company sold the SCFA. Refer to Note 12 for further information.

(5)At December 31, 2023, the Company recognized its proportionate share of the non-cash impairment charge on long-lived assets at NGM, which resulted in a remaining long-lived asset balance of $22. The estimated fair value was based on observable market values for comparable assets expressed as dollar per ounce of mineral resources and was considered a non-recurring Level 3 fair value measurement.

("Lundin Gold") in which the Company holds a 31.9% equity interest (refer to Note 13 for further information). The SCFA was a financial instrument that met the definition of a derivative and was accounted for at fair value using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model, but was not designated for hedge accounting under ASC 815. The fair value of the SCFA was $276 at December 31, 2023, of which $113 was recognized in current Derivative assets and $163 was recognized in non-current Derivative assets.
In the second quarter of 2024, the Company completed the sale of the SCFA and Offtake agreement in which Lundin Gold repurchased the SCFA and settled the rights under the Offtake agreement for cash consideration of $330, of which $180 and $150 was received in the second and third quarter of 2024, respectively. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Offtake agreement. The sale resulted in a gain of $49 recognized in Other Income (loss), net.

Hedging Instruments

Foreign currency cash flow hedges
In June 2024, the Company initiated a hedge program by entering into AUD-denominated fixed forward contracts, with A$717 entered into as of September 30, 2024, to mitigate variability in the USD-functional cash flows related to the AUD-denominated capital expenditures to be incurred during the construction and development phase of the Tanami Expansion 2 project, Cadia PC1-2 and PC2-3 ("Cadia Block Caves") and Cadia Tailings Project ("Cadia Tails") to be incurred between October 2024 and December 2025. The capital expenditures hedged for the Tanami Expansion 2 project under these fixed forward contracts will be for spend not covered by the hedges entered into in October 2022, as described below. The fixed forward contracts were transacted for risk management purposes. The Company has designated the fixed forward contracts as foreign currency cash flow hedges against the forecasted AUD-denominated capital expenditures for the Tanami Expansion 2, Cadia Block Caves, and Cadia Tails projects.

Additionally in June 2024, the Company entered into CAD-denominated and AUD-denominated fixed forward contracts, with C$398 and A$1,491 entered into as of September 30, 2024, respectively, to mitigate variability in the USD-functional cash flows related to the CAD-denominated and AUD-denominated operating expenditures expected to be incurred between October 2024 and December 2025 at the Brucejack and Red Chris operating mines located in Canada and the Boddington, Tanami, and Cadia operating mines located in Australia, respectively. The fixed forward contracts were transacted for risk management purposes. The Company has designated the CAD-denominated and AUD-denominated fixed forward contracts as foreign currency cash flow hedges against the forecasted CAD-denominated and AUD-denominated operating expenditures, respectively.
In October 2022, the Company entered into A$574 of AUD-denominated fixed forward contracts to mitigate variability in the USD-functional cash flows related to the AUD-denominated capital expenditures expected to be incurred in 2023 and 2024 during the construction and development phase of the Tanami Expansion 2 project. The fixed forward contracts were transacted for risk management purposes. The Company has designated the fixed forward contracts as foreign currency cash flow hedges against the forecasted AUD-denominated Tanami Expansion 2 capital expenditures.
To minimize credit risk, the Company only enters into transactions with counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. The Company believes that the risk of counterparty default is low and its exposure to credit risk is minimal.
The unrealized changes in fair value have been recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to income during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the underlying hedge transaction becomes probable of not occurring, the related amounts will be reclassified to earnings immediately. For the foreign currency cash flow hedges related to capital expenditures, amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings through Depreciation and amortization after the respective project reaches commercial production. For the foreign currency cash flow hedges related to operating expenditures, amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings through Costs applicable to sales in the month that the operating expenditures are incurred.

Cadia Power Purchase Agreement ("Cadia PPA")

The Cadia PPA is a 15-year renewable power purchase agreement acquired by the Company through the Newcrest transaction. The Cadia PPA will partially hedge against future power price increases at the Cadia mine and will provide the Company with access to large scale generation certificates which the Company intends to surrender to achieve a reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions. At December 31, 2023, the Cadia PPA was a financial instrument that met the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 and was accounted for at fair value using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model, but was not designated for hedging. At January 1, 2024, the Company designated the Cadia PPA in a cash flow hedging relationship to mitigate the variability in cash flows related to approximately 40 percent of forecasted purchases of power at the Cadia mine for a 15 year period beginning in July 2024.
To minimize credit risk, the Company only enters into transactions with counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. The Company believes that the risk of counterparty default is low and its exposure to credit risk is minimal.
The unrealized changes in fair value have been recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be reclassified to income during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the underlying hedge transaction becomes probable of not occurring, the related amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to earnings immediately. For the Cadia PPA cash flow hedge, amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to earnings through Costs applicable to sales the period in which the related hedged electricity is purchased, which began in July 2024.

NOTE 20     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES


General

Estimated losses from contingencies are accrued by a charge to income when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability could be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated with the contingency are expensed as incurred. If a loss contingency is not probable or reasonably estimable, disclosure of the contingency and estimated range of loss, if determinable, is made in the financial statements when it is at least reasonably possible that a material loss could be incurred.

Operating Segments

The Company’s operating and reportable segments are identified in Note 4. Except as noted in this paragraph, all of the Company’s commitments and contingencies specifically described herein are included in Corporate and Other. The Yanacocha matters relate to the Yanacocha reportable segment. The CC&V matter relates to the CC&V reportable segment. The Goldcorp Canada matter

relates to the Porcupine reportable segment. The Cadia matter relates to the Cadia reportable segment. The Newmont Ghana Gold and Newmont Golden Ridge matters relate to the Ahafo and Akyem reportable segments, respectively. 


Environmental Matters

Refer to Note 7 for further information regarding reclamation and remediation. Details about certain significant matters are discussed below.

Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. - 100% Newmont Owned

In early 2015 and again in June 2017, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, MINAM, issued proposed modifications to water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria modified the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In December 2015, MINAM issued the final regulation that modified the water quality standards. These Peruvian regulations allow time to formulate a compliance plan and make any necessary changes to achieve compliance.
In February 2017, Yanacocha submitted a modification to its previously approved compliance achievement plan to the MINEM. In May 2022, Yanacocha submitted a proposed modification to this plan requesting an extension of time for coming into full compliance with the new regulations to 2027. In June 2023, Yanacocha received approval of its updated compliance plan from MINEM and was granted an extension to June 2026 to achieve compliance. The Company appealed this approval to the Mining Council requesting the regulatory extension until 2027, and in April 2024, MINEM approved the compliance schedule.
The Company currently operates five water treatment plants at Yanacocha that have been and currently meet all currently applicable water discharge requirements. The Company is conducting detailed studies to better estimate water management and other closure activities that will ensure water quality and quantity discharge requirements, including the modifications promulgated by MINAM, as referenced above, will be met. This also includes performing a comprehensive update to the Yanacocha reclamation plan to address changes in closure activities and estimated closure costs while preserving optionality for potential future projects at Yanacocha. These ongoing studies, which will extend beyond the current year, continue to evaluate and revise assumptions and estimated costs of changes to the reclamation plan. While certain estimated costs remain subject to revision, the Company’s current asset retirement obligation includes plans for the construction and post-closure management of two new water treatment plants and initial consideration of known risks (including the associated risk that these water treatment estimates could change in the future as more work is completed). The ultimate construction costs of the two water treatment plants remain uncertain as ongoing study work and assessment of opportunities that incorporates the latest design considerations remain in progress. These and other additional risks and contingencies that are the subject of ongoing studies, including, but not limited to, a comprehensive review of the Company's tailings storage facility management, review of Yanacocha’s water balance and storm water management system, and review of post-closure management costs, could result in future material increases to the reclamation obligation at Yanacocha. 

Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mining Company LLC - 100% Newmont Owned

In December 2021, Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mining Company LLC (“CC&V”, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) entered into a Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) with the Water Quality Control Division of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (the “Division”) with a mutual objective of resolving issues associated with the new discharge permits issued by the Division in January 2021 for the historic Carlton Tunnel. The Carlton Tunnel was a historic tunnel completed in 1941 with the purpose of draining the southern portion of the mining district, subsequently consolidated by CC&V. CC&V has held discharge permits for the Carlton Tunnel since 1983, primarily to focus on monitoring, with the monitoring data accumulated since the mid-1970s indicating consistency in the water quality discharged from the Carlton Tunnel over time. In 2006, legal proceedings and work with the regulator confirmed that the water flowing out of the Carlton Tunnel portal is akin to natural spring water and did not constitute mine drainage. However, this changed with the January 2021 permit updates, when the regulator imposed new water quality limits. The Settlement Agreement involves the evaluation of a reasonable and achievable timeline for treatment and permit compliance, acknowledging the lack of readily available technology, and the need to spend three years to study and select the technological solution, with three additional years to construct, bringing full permit compliance to the November 2027 timeframe. In 2022, the Company studied various interim passive water treatment options, reported the study results to the Division, and based on an evaluation of additional semi-passive options that involve the usage of power at the portal, updated the remediation liability to $20 in 2022. CC&V continues to study alternative long-term remediation plans for water discharged from the Carlton Tunnel, and is also working with regulators on the Discharger Specific Variance to identify highest feasible alternative treatment in the context, based on limits such as area topography. Depending on the plans that may ultimately be agreed with the Division, a material adjustment to the remediation liability may be required.
In July 2024, CC&V received a notice from the Colorado Division of Reclamation Mining and Safety ("DRMS") citing it has reason to believe a violation exists with respect to reporting of monitoring data for mine impacted water at the mine’s East Cresson Overburden Storage Area ("ECOSA"). This matter is being referred to a hearing with the Mining Land Reclamation Board ("MLRB"), which is expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company is working with the regulator and the parties have been working collaboratively on the matter since 2018. The outcome of the MLRB hearing and/or what may ultimately be agreed with the DRMS in a settlement agreement cannot be predicted at this time, but may result in fees, penalties or other permitting adjustments.

Dawn Mining Company LLC (“Dawn”) - 58.19% Newmont Owned


Midnite mine site and Dawn mill site. Dawn previously leased an open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the Spokane Indian Reservation in the State of Washington. The mine site is subject to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Department of Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management), as well as the EPA.

As per the Consent Decree approved by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington on January 17, 2012, the following actions were required of Newmont, Dawn, the Department of the Interior and the EPA: (i) Newmont and Dawn would design, construct and implement the cleanup plan selected by the EPA in 2006 for the Midnite mine site; (ii) Newmont and Dawn would reimburse the EPA for its past costs associated with overseeing the work; (iii) the Department of the Interior would contribute a lump sum amount toward past EPA costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the Midnite mine site; (iv) Newmont and Dawn would be responsible for all future EPA oversight costs and Midnite mine site cleanup costs; and (v) Newmont would post a surety bond for work at the site.
During 2012, the Department of Interior contributed its share of past EPA costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the Midnite mine site. In 2016, Newmont completed the remedial design process, with the exception of the new WTP design which was awaiting the approval of the new NPDES permit. Subsequently, the new NPDES permit was received in 2017 and the WTP design commenced in 2018. The EPA approved the WTP design in 2021. Construction of the effluent pipeline began in 2021, and construction of the new WTP began in 2022. The WTP is projected to be completed in 2024. Forest fires and droughts in the Pacific Northwest delayed the completion of the effluent pipeline until early 2025.
The Dawn mill site is regulated by the Washington Department of Health (the "WDOH") and is in the process of being closed in accordance with the federal Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act, and associated Washington state regulations. Remediation at the Dawn mill site began in 2013. The Tailing Disposal Area 1-4 reclamation earthworks component was completed during 2017 with the embankment erosion protection completed in the second quarter of 2018. The remaining closure activities consist primarily of finalizing an Alternative Concentration Limit application (the "ACL application") submitted in 2020 to the WDOH to address groundwater issues, and also evaporating the remaining balance of process water at the site. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the WDOH provided comments on the ACL application, which Newmont is evaluating and conducting studies to better understand and respond to the comments provided by the WDOH. These studies and the related comment process will extend beyond the current year and could result in future material increases to the remediation obligation. 
The remediation liability for the Midnite mine site and Dawn mill site is approximately $175, assumed 100% by Newmont, at September 30, 2024.

Goldcorp Canada Ltd. - 100% Newmont Owned

Porcupine mine site. The Porcupine complex is comprised of active open pit and underground mining operations as well as inactive, legacy sites from its extensive history of mining gold in and around the city of Timmins, Ontario since the early 1900s. As a result of these primarily historic mining activities, there are mine hazards in the area that could require some form of reclamation. The Company is conducting studies to better catalog, prioritize, and update its existing information of these historical mine hazards, to inform its closure plans and estimated closure costs. Based on work performed during 2023, a $46 reclamation adjustment was recorded at December 31, 2023, however, on-going studies will extend beyond the current year and could result in future material increases to the reclamation obligation at Porcupine.

Cadia Holdings Pty Ltd. - 100% Newmont Owned

Cadia mine site. Cadia Holdings Pty Ltd. (“Cadia Holdings”) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Newcrest, which was acquired by Newmont in November 2023. The mine site is subject to regulations by the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (the “NSW EPA”). During the quarter ended June 2023, the NSW EPA issued variations to its Environment Protection License (“EPL”), a Prevention Notice and Notices to Provide Information regarding the management of, and investigation into potential breaches relating to, dust emissions and other air pollutants from Cadia Holdings’ tailings storage facilities and ventilation rises. The license variations largely formalized the actions Cadia Holdings had developed in consultation with the NSW EPA and was already undertaking across a range of measures. Cadia Holdings received a letter from the NSW EPA in June 2023 requiring it to immediately comply with specific statutory requirements and EPL conditions. Adjustments were implemented underground, including a reduction in mining rates, modifications to the ventilation circuit and the installation of additional dust sprays and spray curtains. Additional dust collection units were subsequently installed, enabling normal mining rates to be restored.
In August 2023, the NSW EPA commenced proceedings in the Land and Environment Court of NSW (the “NSW Land and Environment Court”) against Cadia Holdings, alleging that air emissions from Cadia on or about March 1, 2022 exceeded the standard of concentration for total solid particles permitted under applicable laws due to the use of surface exhaust fans at the mine. On September 29, 2023, Cadia Holdings entered a plea of guilty and the NSW Land and Environment Court listed the case for a sentencing hearing on June 21, 2024. On October 13, 2023, the NSW EPA commenced additional proceedings in the NSW Land and Environment Court against Cadia Holdings, alleging two additional contraventions of applicable air emissions requirements between November 3 and 5, 2021 and May 24 and 25, 2023 and two contraventions related to alleged air pollution from tailings storage facilities on October 13 and 31, 2022. On November 24, 2023, Cadia Holdings entered a plea of guilty to the two additional charges relating to applicable air

emissions requirements and the sentencing hearing took place before the NSW Land and Environment Court on June 21, 2024. The matter has been adjourned pending the delivery of the judgment. On October 18, 2024, Cadia Holdings entered a plea of not guilty to the proceedings related to alleged air pollution from Cadia Holdings’ tailings storage facilities. The proceedings have been adjourned for further directions on February 21, 2025. The NSW EPA’s investigation regarding the management of air emissions from the mine is ongoing.
While no specific relief has been sought by the NSW EPA in its proceedings against Cadia Holdings before the NSW Land and Environmental Court, the court can impose penalties.

Kirkland Lake Gold Inc., which was acquired by Agnico Eagle Mines Limited in 2022 (still referred to herein as “Kirkland” for ease of reference), owns certain mining and mineral rights in northeastern Ontario, Canada, referred to here as the Holt-McDermott property, on which it suspended operations in April 2020. A subsidiary of the Company has a retained royalty obligation (“Holt royalty obligation”) to Royal Gold, Inc. (“Royal Gold”) for production on the Holt-McDermott property. In August 2020, the Company and Kirkland signed a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the “Kirkland Agreement”). As part of the Kirkland Agreement, the Company purchased an option (the “Holt option”) for $75 from Kirkland for the mining and mineral rights subject to the Holt royalty obligation. The Company has the right to exercise the Holt option and acquire ownership to the mineral interests subject to the Holt royalty obligation in the event Kirkland intends to resume operations and process material subject to the obligation. Kirkland has the right to assume the Company’s Holt royalty obligation at any time, in which case the Holt option would terminate.
On August 16, 2021, International Royalty Corporation (“IRC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Gold, filed an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against Newmont Corporation, Newmont Canada Corporation, Newmont Canada FN Holdings ULC (collectively "Newmont"), and certain Kirkland defendants (collectively "Kirkland"). IRC alleges the Kirkland Agreement is oppressive to the interests of Royal Gold under the Nova Scotia Companies Act and the Canada Business Corporations Act, and that, by entering into the Kirkland Agreement, Newmont breached its contractual obligations to Royal Gold. IRC seeks declaratory relief, and $350 in alleged royalty payments that it claims Newmont expected to pay under the Holt royalty obligation, but for the Kirkland Agreement. Kirkland filed a motion seeking dismissal of the case against it, which the court granted in October 2022. Newmont submitted its statement of defense on February 27, 2023, and a motion for summary judgment on January 12, 2024. The motion for summary judgment was denied on May 27, 2024. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.

Newmont Ghana Gold Limited and Newmont Golden Ridge Limited - 100% Newmont Owned

On December 24, 2018, two individual plaintiffs, who are members of the Ghana Parliament (“Plaintiffs”), filed a writ to invoke the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Ghana. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the Statement of Plaintiff’s Case outlining the details of the Plaintiff’s case and subsequently served Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (“NGGL”) and Newmont Golden Ridge Limited (“NGRL”) along with the other named defendants, the Attorney General of Ghana, the Minerals Commission of Ghana and 33 other mining companies with interests in Ghana. The Plaintiffs allege that under article 268 of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana, the mining company defendants are not entitled to carry out any exploitation of minerals or other natural resources in Ghana, unless their respective transactions, contracts or concessions are ratified or exempted from ratification by the Parliament of Ghana. Newmont’s current mining leases are both ratified by Parliament; NGGL June 13, 2001 mining lease, ratified by Parliament on October 21, 2008, and NGRL January 19, 2010 mining lease; ratified by Parliament on December 3, 2015. The writ alleges that any mineral exploitation prior to Parliamentary ratification is unconstitutional. The Plaintiffs seek several remedies including: (i) a declaration as to the meaning of constitutional language at issue; (ii) an injunction precluding exploitation of minerals for any mining company without prior Parliamentary ratification; (iii) a declaration that all revenue as a result of violation of the Constitution shall be accounted for and recovered via cash equivalent; and (iv) an order that the Attorney General and Minerals Commission submit all un-ratified mining leases, undertakings or contracts to Parliament for ratification. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.

Newmont Capital Limited and Newmont Canada FN Holdings ULC – 100% Newmont Owned 

The Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) conducted a limited review of the Company’s prior year tax returns, and reviewed an internal reorganization executed in 2011 when Newmont completed a restructure of the shareholding in the Company’s Australian subsidiaries. As previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the ATO notified the Company that it believes the 2011 reorganization is subject to capital gains tax of approximately $85 (including interest and penalties). The Company disputed this conclusion. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made a $24 payment to the ATO and lodged an appeal with the Australian Federal Court to preserve its right to contest the ATO conclusions on this matter. A trial was held in the third quarter of 2024. The Company is vigorously defending its position that the transaction is not subject to Australian capital gains tax. The decision of the Court remains pending. The Company cannot reasonably predict the outcome.

(unaudited, dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)


Other Commitments and Contingencies

As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company and its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank letters of credit and bank guarantees as financial support for various purposes, including environmental remediation, reclamation, exploration permitting, workers compensation programs and other general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were $2,257 and $2,123, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. The obligations associated with these instruments are generally related to performance requirements that the Company addresses through its ongoing operations. As the specific requirements are met, the beneficiary of the associated instrument cancels and/or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these instruments are associated with operating sites with long-lived assets and will remain outstanding until closure. Generally, bonding requirements associated with environmental regulation are becoming more restrictive. However, the Company believes it is in compliance with all applicable bonding obligations and will be able to satisfy future bonding requirements through existing or alternative means, as they arise.
Newmont is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings related to its business. Except in the above described proceedings, management does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or that amounts that may be required to be paid by reason thereof will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Refer to Note 25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 for information on the Company's contingent payments.

Divestment of Non-Core Assets

In February 2024, based on a comprehensive review of the Company’s portfolio of assets, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a portfolio optimization program to divest six non-core assets and a development project. The non-core assets to be divested include CC&V, Musselwhite, Porcupine, Éléonore, Telfer, Akyem, and the Coffee development project in Canada. In February 2024, the Company concluded that these non-core assets and the development project met the accounting requirements to be presented as held for sale in the first quarter of 2024, based on progress made through our active sales program and management’s expectation that the sale is probable and will be completed within 12 months. While the Company remains committed to a plan to sell these assets for a fair price, there is a possibility that the assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond the Company's control. Upon meeting the requirements to be presented as held for sale, the six non-core assets and the development project were recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell, and will be periodically valued until sale occurs. As a result, a loss of $115 and $846 was recognized within Loss on assets held for sale for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For further information, refer to Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In September 2024, the Company entered into a binding agreement to sell the assets of the Telfer reportable segment to Greatland Gold plc. In October 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Akyem reportable segment to Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. (“Zijin”). The sales are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the terms of the agreements on its consolidated financial statements. The Telfer and Akyem assets and liabilities remain designated as held for sale as of September 30, 2024.

Refer to Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's assets and liabilities held for sale.


Newcrest Transaction

On November 6, 2023, the Company completed its business combination transaction with Newcrest Mining Limited, a public Australian mining company limited by shares ("Newcrest"), whereby Newmont, through Newmont Overseas Holdings Pty Ltd, an Australian proprietary company limited by shares (“Newmont Sub”), acquired all of the ordinary shares of Newcrest in a fully stock transaction for total non-cash consideration of $13,549. Newcrest became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Sub and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont (such acquisition, the “Newcrest transaction”). The combined company continues to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker NEM. The combined company is also listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange 


under the ticker NGT, on the Australian Securities Exchange under the ticker NEM, and on the Papua New Guinea Securities Exchange under the ticker NEM. For further information, refer to Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.


For further information on acquisitions, divestitures, and asset sales impacting the comparability of our results, refer to Notes 1 and 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.

The increase in Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, is primarily due to the impact of sites acquired in the Newcrest transaction.
Excluding the impact of sites acquired in the Newcrest transaction, the increase in Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, at sites held in the prior period was primarily due to an increase in Sales at Peñasquito as a result of the work stoppage due to a labor strike that began in June 2023 ("Peñasquito labor strike"), resulting in no sales at Peñasquito in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders increased due to higher average realized prices primarily for gold. This increase was partially offset by the Loss on assets held for sale of $115 and higher Costs applicable to sales.
Excluding the impact of sites acquired in the Newcrest transaction, the increase in Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, at sites held in the prior period was primarily due to an increase in Sales resulting from the Peñasquito labor strike in 2023, higher average realized prices for all metals, partially offset by the Loss on assets held for sale of $846 and higher Costs applicable to sales.

(2)For the three months ended September 30, 2023 the Company sold 11 thousand tonnes of copper, — thousand tonnes of lead, and (1) thousand tonnes of zinc.
(3)Due to the Peñasquito labor strike, Peñasquito had no production during the third quarter of 2023. Sales activity recognized in the third quarter of 2023 is related to adjustments on provisionally priced concentrate sales subject to final settlement. As such, the average realized price per ounce/pound metrics are not meaningful ("N.M.").

____________________________
(1)Due to the Peñasquito labor strike in 2023, no production occurred in the third quarter of 2023. As a result, the change in consolidated Sales for silver, lead, and zinc for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, are primarily attributable to the change in consolidated ounces/pounds sold.

The increase in Costs applicable to sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, is primarily due to the impact of sites acquired in the Newcrest transaction, which contributed $599 and $1,613, respectively, to Costs applicable to sales.
The increase in Costs applicable to sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, was further impacted by the Peñasquito labor strike in 2023, a drawdown of inventory and higher royalties at Ahafo and Akyem and higher contracted services and labor costs at Ahafo, partially offset by a decrease in Costs applicable to sales at Boddington due to lower production.
For discussion regarding other significant drivers impacting Costs applicable to sales by site, see Results of Consolidated Operations below.

The details of our Depreciation and amortization are set forth below. Refer to Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The increase in Depreciation and amortization for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, is primarily due to the impact of sites acquired in the Newcrest transaction, which contributed $198 and $506, respectively, to Depreciation and amortization.
The increase in Depreciation and amortization for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, is further impacted by higher depreciation rates as a result of (i) higher ounces mined at Peñasquito in the current year due to the Peñasquito labor strike in 2023 and (ii) higher ounces mined and asset additions at Ahafo. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Depreciation and amortization related to the cessation of depreciation beginning in March 2024 for sites classified as held for sale. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in Depreciation and amortization was further offset by a decrease at Cerro Negro as a result of suspending mining at the site due to the tragic fatalities during the second quarter. Refer to Note 5 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of held for sale.
For discussion regarding other significant drivers impacting Depreciation and amortization by site, see Results of Consolidated Operations below.
Advanced projects, research and development expense was $47 and $53 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $149 and $132 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, is primarily due to Full Potential spend at the sites acquired through the Newcrest transaction.
General and administrative expense was $113 and $70 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and $314 and $215 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, is primarily due to higher salaries and benefits and non-integration related consulting and other charges resulting from the Newcrest transaction.
Interest expense, net was $86 and $48 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $282 and $162 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense, net increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily as a result of the increase to Debt largely due to the $2,000 unsecured senior notes issued in March 2024 and the senior notes acquired through the Newcrest transaction.
Income and mining tax expense (benefit) was $244 and $73 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $695 and $449 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate is driven by a number of factors and the comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods will be primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) geographic distribution of that income; (iii) impacts of the changes in tax law; (iv) valuation allowances on tax assets; (v) percentage depletion; (vi) fluctuation in the value of the USD and foreign currencies; and (vii) the impact of specific transactions and assessments. As a result, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, year to year. This trend is expected to continue in future periods. Refer to Note 10 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of income taxes.

(1)Represents income (loss) from continuing operations by geographic location before income taxes and equity income (loss) of affiliates. These amounts will not reconcile to the Segment Information for the reasons stated in Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2)In accordance with applicable accounting rules, the interim provision for income taxes is adjusted to equal the consolidated tax rate.

In 2024, Pillar II is set to take effect. The Pillar II agreement was signed by 138 countries with the intent to equalize corporate tax around the world by implementing a global minimum tax of 15%. As Newmont primarily does business in jurisdictions with a tax rate greater than 15%, the Company does not anticipate a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

Net income (loss) from discontinued operations was $49 and $1 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $68 and $15 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, is primarily due to the sale of the Batu and Elang contingent consideration assets, including the income tax benefit associated with a release of a valuation allowance on the capital loss carryforward in the U.S. Refer to Note 12 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Refer to the Notes of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for explanations of other financial statement line items.


Results of Consolidated Operations

Newmont has developed gold equivalent ounces ("GEO") metrics to provide a comparable basis for analysis and understanding of our operations and performance related to copper, silver, lead and zinc. Gold equivalent ounces are calculated as pounds or ounces produced or sold multiplied by the ratio of the other metals’ price to the gold price, using the metal prices in the table below:

(2)All-in sustaining costs is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below.
(3)Sites acquired through the Newcrest transaction during the fourth quarter of 2023, and as such, the comparative results of operations information is not meaningful. Refer to Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Newcrest transaction.
(4)Sites were classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2024, and as such, the Company ceased recording depreciation and amortization at these sites in March 2024. Refer to Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our assets and liabilities held for sale.
(5)During the second quarter, seepage points were detected on the outer wall and around the tailings storage facility at Telfer and we temporarily ceased placing new tailings on the facility. Production resumed at the end of the third quarter, but as a result of the temporary suspension of production, per ounce metrics are not meaningful ("N.M."). In September 2024, the Company entered into a binding agreement to sell the assets of the Telfer reportable segment. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

(6)In October 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Akyem reportable segment. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Depreciation and amortization per gold ounce decreased 73% primarily due to cessation of depreciation and amortization as a result of classifying the asset as held for sale. All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce decreased 16% primarily due to lower Costs applicable to sales per gold ounce.
Porcupine, Canada. Gold production increased 15% primarily due to higher ore grade milled and higher mill recovery. Costs applicable to sales per gold ounce decreased 7% primarily due to higher gold ounces sold and lower equipment and maintenance costs, partially offset by higher labor costs. Depreciation and amortization per gold ounce decreased 65% primarily due to cessation of depreciation and amortization as a result of classifying the asset as held for sale. All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce decreased 8% primarily due to lower Costs applicable to sales per gold ounce, partially offset by higher sustaining capital spend.
Éléonore, Canada. Gold production was generally in line with the prior year.

Depreciation and amortization per gold ounce decreased 72% primarily due to cessation of depreciation and amortization as a result of classifying the asset as held for sale. All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce were generally in line with the prior year.
Akyem, Ghana. Gold production decreased 16% primarily due to lower ore grade milled, partially offset by higher mill throughput. Costs applicable to sales per gold ounce increased 56% primarily due to a drawdown of stockpile inventory, higher third-party royalties, and lower gold ounces sold. Depreciation and amortization per gold ounce decreased 31% primarily due to cessation of depreciation and amortization as a result of classifying the asset as held for sale. All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce increased 36% primarily due to higher Costs applicable to sales per gold ounce, partially offset by lower sustaining capital spend.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

Our foreign operations sell their gold, copper, silver, lead, and zinc production based on USD metal prices. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates do not have a material impact on our revenue. Despite selling gold and silver in London, we have no exposure to the euro or the British pound.
Foreign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profits to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies. Approximately 55% and 59% of Costs applicable to sales were paid in currencies other than the USD during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as follows:

Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the USD at our foreign mining operations decreased Costs applicable to sales at sites held prior to the Newcrest transaction by $116 and $129 per gold ounce during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to significant currency devaluation in Argentina that occurred starting in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation, Costs applicable to sales at sites held prior to the Newcrest transaction increased by $3 and decreased by $2 per gold ounce during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, resulting from variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the USD at our other foreign mining operations.
Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the USD at our foreign mining operations decreased Costs applicable to sales per gold equivalent ounce at sites held prior to the Newcrest transaction by $38 and $1, primarily in Mexico, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.
At September 30, 2024, the Company held AUD- and CAD-denominated fixed forward contracts to mitigate variability in the USD functional cash flows related to the AUD- and CAD-denominated operating expenditures to be incurred between October 2024 and December 2025 at certain sites, respectively. The unrealized changes in fair value for the fixed forward contracts are recorded in 

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be reclassified to earnings through Costs applicable to sales beginning October 2024. Refer to Note 12 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our hedging instruments.
Our Ahafo and Akyem mines, located in Ghana, are USD functional currency entities. Ghana has experienced significant inflation over the last three years and has a highly inflationary economy. In 2021, the Bank of Ghana created a gold purchase program in the effort to stabilize the local currency and build up gold reserves through domestic gold purchases conducted in local currency at prevailing market rates. As the gold purchase program was voluntary, there was no significant impact to Ahafo. The majority of Ahafo’s activity has historically been denominated in USD; as a result, the devaluation of the Ghanaian cedi has resulted in an immaterial impact on our financial statements. Therefore, future devaluation of the Ghanaian cedi is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
Our Cerro Negro mine, located in Argentina, is a USD functional currency entity. Argentina has experienced significant inflation over the last three years and has a highly inflationary economy. Beginning in 2020, Argentina’s central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency, including requiring the Company to convert USD proceeds from metal sales to local currency within 60 days from shipment date or five business days from receipt of cash, whichever happens first, as well as restricting payments to foreign-related entities denominated in foreign currency, such as dividends or distributions to the parent and related companies and royalties and other payments to foreign beneficiaries. These restrictions directly impact Cerro Negro's ability to repay intercompany debt to the Company. In the third quarter, certain restrictions were lifted or modified, allowing companies to repay intercompany debt in certain circumstances. We continue to monitor the foreign currency exposure risk and the evolution of limitations of repatriating cash to the U.S. Currently, these currency controls are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
Our Merian mine, located in the country of Suriname, is a USD functional currency entity. Suriname has experienced significant inflation over the last three years and has a highly inflationary economy. In 2021, the Central Bank took steps to stabilize the local currency, while the government introduced new legislation to narrow the gap between government revenues and spending. The measures to increase government revenue mainly consist of tax increases; however, Newmont and the Republic of Suriname have a Mineral Agreement in place that supersedes such measures. The Central Bank of Suriname adopted a controlled floating rate system, which resulted in a concurrent devaluation of the Surinamese dollar. The majority of Merian’s activity has historically been denominated in USD; as a result, historical devaluation of the Surinamese dollar resulted in an immaterial impact on our financial statements. Future appreciation or devaluation of the Surinamese dollar is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources


Liquidity Overview

We have a disciplined capital allocation strategy of maintaining financial flexibility to execute our capital priorities and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Consistent with that strategy, we aim to self-fund development projects and make strategic partnerships focused on profitable growth, while reducing our debt and returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.
The Company continues to experience the impacts from geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures. With the resulting volatile environment, we continue to monitor inflationary conditions, the effects of certain countermeasures taken by central banks, and the potential for further supply chain disruptions, as well as an uncertain and evolving labor market. Depending on the duration and extent of the impact of these events, or changes in commodity prices, the prices for gold and other metals, and foreign exchange rates, we could continue to experience volatility; transportation industry disruptions could continue, including limitations on shipping produced metals; our supply chain could continue to experience disruption; cost inflation rates could further increase; or we could incur credit related losses of certain financial assets, which could materially impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
As of September 30, 2024, we believe our available liquidity allows us to manage the short- and, possibly, long-term material adverse impacts of these events on our business. Refer to Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on risks and uncertainties.
At September 30, 2024, the Company had $3,102 of cash and cash equivalents, of which $3,016 was included in Cash and cash equivalents and $86 was included in Assets held for sale related to certain non-core assets that were classified as held for sale in the first quarter of 2024. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in a variety of highly liquid and low-risk investments with original maturities of three months or less that are available to fund our operations as necessary. We may have investments in prime money market funds that are classified as cash and cash equivalents; however, we continually monitor the need for reclassification under the SEC requirements for money market funds, and the potential that the shares of such funds could have a net asset value of less than their par value. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund our operations and corporate activities.
At September 30, 2024, $1,653 of Cash and cash equivalents was held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily held in USD-denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to USD. Cash and cash equivalents denominated in Argentine peso are subject to regulatory restrictions. Refer to Foreign Currency Exchange Rates above for further information. At 
September 30, 2024, $1,504 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. We expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with any potential withholding taxes.
We believe our existing consolidated Cash and cash equivalents, available capacity on our revolving credit facility, and cash generated from continuing operations will be adequate to satisfy working capital needs, fund future growth, meet debt obligations and meet other liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. At September 30, 2024, our borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility was $4,000 and we had no borrowings outstanding. We continue to remain compliant with covenants and do not currently anticipate any events or circumstances that would impact our ability to access funds available on this facility. Refer to Note 16 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our Debt.

____________________________
(1)During the first quarter of 2024, certain non-core assets were determined to meet the criteria for assets held for sale. As a result, the related Cash and cash equivalents was reclassified to Assets held for sale. Refer to Note 5 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
(2)In connection with the Newcrest transaction, the Company acquired bilateral bank facilities that were repaid in full in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, the revolving credit facility was amended in February 2024 to increase the available borrowing capacity to $4,000. Refer to Note 16 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
(3)Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management to evaluate financial flexibility and strength of the Company's balance sheet. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below.

Cash Flows

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations was $3,807 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase in cash provided of $1,669 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in Sales resulting from the impact of sites acquired in the Newcrest transaction, the Peñasquito labor strike in 2023, higher sales volumes at Ahafo, and higher average realized gold prices. These inflows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of sales and shipments, and a payment of $291 made in the first quarter for stamp duty tax related to the Newcrest transaction.
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations was $(2,154) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase in cash used of $1,401 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower net maturities of time deposits and higher capital expenditures in 2024.
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1,746) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase in cash used of $681 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to repurchases of common stock and net repayments of debt transactions, partially offset by lower dividend payments in 2024. Refer to Note 16 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our Debt transactions.

Capital Resources

In October 2024, the Board declared a dividend of $0.25 per share. The declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the full discretion of the Board and will depend on the Company’s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
In February 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of outstanding common stock to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock award vesting and to provide returns to shareholders, provided that the aggregate value of shares of common stock repurchased under the new program does not exceed $1 billion. The program will expire after 24 months (in February 2026). In October 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $2 billion stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of outstanding common stock. The program will expire after 24 months (in October 2026). The programs will be executed at the Company’s discretion. The repurchase programs may be discontinued at any time, and the programs do not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares of its common stock or to repurchase the full authorized amount during the authorization period. Consequently, the Board of Directors may revise or terminate such share repurchase authorization in the future. Through the date of filing, we have executed and settled trades totaling $750 of common stock repurchases under the previously authorized program, of which $448 were repurchased through September 30, 2024.

Capital Expenditures

Cash generated from operations is used to execute our capital priorities, which include sustaining and developing our global portfolio of long-lived assets. Our near-term development capital projects include Tanami Expansion 2 and Ahafo North, as well as the Cadia Block Caves project which was acquired in the Newcrest transaction. These projects are being funded from existing liquidity and will continue to be funded from future operating cash flows. 
We consider sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. Capital expenditures to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations, where these projects will enhance production or reserves, are considered non-sustaining or development capital. The Company’s decision to reprioritize, sell or abandon a development project, which may include returning mining concessions to host governments, could result in a future impairment charge.
Additionally, as part of our ESG initiatives, in November 2021, Newmont announced a strategic alliance with CAT and pledged a preliminary investment of $100 with the aim to develop and implement a comprehensive all-electric autonomous mining system to achieve zero emissions mining. Newmont has paid $56 as of September 30, 2024, and the remaining pledged amount is anticipated to be paid as certain milestones are reached through 2025. Payments are recognized in Advanced projects, research and development within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Other investments supporting our climate change initiatives are expected to include emissions reduction projects and renewable energy opportunities as we seek to achieve these climate targets. For risks related to climate-related capital expenditures, refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.

For additional information on our capital expenditures, refer to Part II, Item 7, Liquidity and Capital Resources of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had Additions to property, plant and mine development, inclusive of capitalized interest, as follows:

Debt 

Debt and Corporate Revolving Credit Facilities. In connection with the Newcrest transaction, the Company acquired bilateral bank debt facilities (the "bilateral facilities") held with 13 banks. The bilateral facilities due February 7, 2024 include the 3 banks that exercised their option under the change of effective control event. On February 7, 2024, the Company repaid the 3 non-consenting banks with a total borrowing capacity of $462. On February 15, 2024, the Company completed an amendment and restatement of its existing $3,000 revolving credit agreement dated as of April 4, 2019 (the “Existing Credit Agreement”). The Existing Credit Agreement was entered into with a syndicate of financial institutions and provided for borrowings in U.S. dollars and contained a letter of credit sub-facility. Per the amendment, the expiration date of the credit facility was extended from March 30, 2026 to February 15, 2029 and the borrowing capacity was increased to $4,000. Interest is based on Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment and margin. Concurrently, the Company utilized the $4,000 revolving credit agreement and used the proceeds thereof to repay the remaining $1,461 owed on the remaining bilateral facilities.
In the first quarter 2024, we issued $2,000 of unsecured Senior Notes comprised of $1,000 due March 30, 2026 (“2026 Senior Notes”) and $1,000 due March 30, 2034 ("2034 Senior Notes"). Net proceeds from the 2026 and 2034 Senior Notes were $1,980, which were used to fully repay the drawdown on the revolving credit facility. Interest will be paid semi-annually at a rate of 5.30% and 5.35% per annum for the 2026 and the 2034 Senior Notes, respectively.
In the second and third quarter of 2024, the Company redeemed an aggregate amount of $250 and $150 of certain Senior Notes, respectively. As a result of these redemptions, the Company recognized gain on extinguishment of $15 and $35 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, recognized in Other income (loss), net. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the gain on extinguishment was partially offset by the acceleration of $6 loss from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income related to the previously terminated interest rate cash flow hedges.
Debt Covenants. There were no material changes to our debt covenants. Refer to Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, for information regarding our debt covenants. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all existing debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults.

Refer to Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Co-Issuer and Supplemental Guarantor Information. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as amended, which enables us to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, depository shares, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, warrants and units (the “Shelf Registration Statement”). Under the Shelf Registration Statement, our debt securities may be guaranteed by Newmont USA Limited (“Newmont USA”), one of our consolidated subsidiaries.

Newmont and Newcrest Finance Pty Ltd ("Newcrest Finance"), as issuers, and Newmont USA, as guarantor, are collectively referred to here-within as the "Obligor Group".

These guarantees are full and unconditional, and none of our other subsidiaries guarantee any security issued and outstanding. The cash provided by operations of the Obligor Group, and all of its subsidiaries, is available to satisfy debt repayments as they become due, and there are no material restrictions on the ability of the Obligor Group to obtain funds from subsidiaries, including 
funds at subsidiaries classified as assets held for sale, by dividend, loan, or otherwise, except to the extent of any rights of noncontrolling interests or regulatory restrictions limiting repatriation of cash. Net assets attributable to noncontrolling interests were $184 and $178 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. All noncontrolling interests relate to non-guarantor subsidiaries. For further information on our noncontrolling interests, refer to Note 1 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Newmont and Newmont USA are primarily holding companies with no material operations, sources of income or assets other than equity interest in their subsidiaries and intercompany receivables or payables. Newcrest Finance is a finance subsidiary with no material assets or operations other than those related to issued external debt. Newmont USA’s primary investments are comprised of its 38.5% interest in NGM. For further information regarding these and our other operations, refer to Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Results of Consolidated Operations within Part I, Item 2, MD&A.
In addition to equity interests in subsidiaries, the Obligor Group’s balance sheets consisted primarily of the following intercompany assets, intercompany liabilities, and external debt. The remaining assets and liabilities of the Obligor Group are considered immaterial at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Newmont USA's subsidiary guarantees (the “subsidiary guarantees”) are general unsecured senior obligations of Newmont USA and rank equal in right of payment to all of Newmont USA's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of Newmont USA's future subordinated indebtedness. The subsidiary guarantees are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of Newmont USA to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
At September 30, 2024, Newmont USA had approximately $8,544 of consolidated indebtedness (including guaranteed debt), all of which relates to the guarantees of indebtedness of Newmont.
Under the terms of the subsidiary guarantees, holders of Newmont’s securities subject to such subsidiary guarantees will not be required to exercise their remedies against Newmont before they proceed directly against Newmont USA.
Newmont USA will be released and relieved from all its obligations under the subsidiary guarantees in certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following:
•upon the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of a majority of the total voting power of the capital stock or other interests of Newmont USA (other than to Newmont or any of Newmont’s affiliates);
•upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of Newmont USA (other than to Newmont or any of Newmont’s affiliates); or
•upon such time as Newmont USA ceases to guarantee more than $75 aggregate principal amount of Newmont’s debt (at September 30, 2024, Newmont USA guaranteed $600 aggregate principal amount of debt of Newmont that did not contain a similar fall-away provision).
Newmont’s debt securities are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of Newmont to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities of Newmont’s non-guarantor subsidiaries. At September 30, 2024, (i) Newmont’s total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $9,099, none of which was secured (other than $549 of Lease and other financing obligations), and (ii) Newmont’s non-guarantor subsidiaries had $9,128 of total liabilities (including trade payables, but excluding intercompany and external debt and reclamation and remediation liabilities), which would have been structurally senior to Newmont’s debt securities.

For further information on our debt, refer to Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net Debt

Net Debt is calculated as Debt and Lease and other financing obligations less Cash and cash equivalents, as presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash and cash equivalents are subtracted from Debt and Lease and other financing obligations as these could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations. 
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Net Debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to Debt and Lease and other financing obligations, which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to Net Debt.

(12)Sites are classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 5 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our assets and liabilities held for sale.

(13)Gold equivalent ounces is calculated as pounds or ounces produced multiplied by the ratio of the other metals price to the gold price, using Gold ($1,400/oz.), Copper ($3.50/lb.), Silver ($20.00/oz.), Lead ($1.00/lb.) and Zinc ($1.20/lb.) pricing for 2024.
(14)For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Red Chris sold 6 thousand tonnes of copper, Peñasquito sold 6 million ounces of silver, 17 thousand tonnes of lead and 61 thousand tonnes of zinc, Boddington sold 8 thousand tonnes of copper, Cadia sold 21 thousand tonnes of copper, and Telfer sold — thousand tonnes of copper.
(15)During the second quarter, seepage points were detected on the outer wall and around the tailings storage facility at Telfer and we temporarily ceased placing new tailings on the facility. Production resumed during the third quarter of 2024, but as a result of the temporary suspension of production, per ounce metrics are not meaningful ("N.M."). In September 2024, the Company entered into a binding agreement to sell the assets of the Telfer reportable segment. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

(16)In October 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Akyem reportable segment. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

ITEM 3.       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.(dollars in millions, except per ounce and per pound amounts)

Metal Prices

Changes in the market price of gold significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the strength of the USD; inflation, deflation, or other general price instability; and global mine production levels. Changes in the market price of copper, silver, lead and zinc also affect our profitability and cash flow. These metals are traded on established international exchanges and prices generally reflect market supply and demand but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. The Company does not currently hold instruments that are designated to hedge against the potential impacts due to market price changes in metals. Consideration of these impacts are discussed below.
Decreases in the market price of metals can also significantly affect the value of our product inventory, stockpiles and leach pads, and it may be necessary to record a write-down to the net realizable value, as well as significantly impact our carrying value of long-lived assets and goodwill. Refer to Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, for information regarding the sensitivity of our impairment analyses over long-lived assets and goodwill to changes in metal price.
Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of our stockpiles, leach pads and product inventory include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. 
The significant assumptions in determining the stockpile, leach pad and product inventory adjustments for each mine site reporting unit at September 30, 2024 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, and the following short-term and long-term assumptions:|    |                          |            |       |           |    |       |
|---:|:-------------------------|:-----------|:------|:----------|:---|:------|
|  1 |                          | Short-Term |       | Long-Term |    |       |
|  2 | Gold price (per ounce)   | $          | 2,474 |           | $  | 1,700 |
|  3 | Copper price (per pound) | $          | 4.18  |           | $  | 3.75  |
|  4 | Silver price (per ounce) | $          | 29.43 |           | $  | 22.00 |
|  5 | Lead price (per pound)   | $          | 0.93  |           | $  | 0.90  |
|  6 | Zinc price (per pound)   | $          | 1.26  |           | $  | 1.25  |
|  7 | AUD to USD exchange rate | $          | 0.67  |           | $  | 0.70  |
|  8 | CAD to USD exchange rate | $          | 0.73  |           | $  | 0.75  |
|  9 | MXN to USD exchange rate | $          | 0.05  |           | $  | 0.05  |
The net realizable value measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. 

Interest Rate Risk

We are subject to interest rate risk related to the fair value of our senior notes which is wholly comprised of fixed rates at September 30, 2024. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. The terms of our fixed rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these 
obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity which could be material. See Note 11 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information pertaining to the fair value of our fixed rate debt. 

Foreign Currency

In addition to our operations in the U.S., we have significant operations and/or assets in Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Ecuador, Fiji and Ghana. All of our operations sell their gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc production based on USD metal prices. Foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and U.S. currencies and U.S. and foreign country economic conditions. Fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the USD can increase or decrease profit margins, capital expenditures, cash flow and Costs applicable to sales per ounce to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. 
We performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact to Costs applicable to sales per ounce arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement to local currency exchange rates at September 30, 2024 in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations, with no mitigation assumed from our foreign currency cash flow hedges. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement would result in an approximate $75 increase to Costs applicable to sales per ounce for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Commodity Price Exposure

Our provisional concentrate sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the respective metal concentrates at the prevailing indices’ prices at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which is not designated for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement.
We perform an analysis on the provisional concentrate sales to determine the potential impact to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders for each 10% change to the average price on the provisional concentrate sales subject to final pricing over the next several months. Refer below for our analysis as of September 30, 2024.

Hedging Instruments

The Company's hedging instruments consisted of the Cadia Power Purchase Agreement ("Cadia PPA") and foreign currency cash flow hedges at September 30, 2024, which were transacted for risk management purposes. The Cadia PPA mitigates the variability in future cash flows related to a portion of power purchases at the Cadia mine and the foreign currency cash flow hedges were entered into to mitigate variability in the USD functional cash flows related to the AUD- and CAD-denominated operating expenditures and AUD-denominated capital expenditures. By using hedges, we are affected by market risk, credit risk, and market liquidity risk. Refer to Note 12 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our hedging instruments. 

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be adversely affected by a change in commodity prices or currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition. We manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We mitigate this potential risk to our financial condition by establishing trading agreements with counterparties under which we are not required to post any collateral or be subject to any margin calls on our derivatives. Our counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative.
We have performed sensitivity analyses as of September 30, 2024 regarding the Cadia PPA and foreign currency cash flow hedges. For the Cadia PPA, we utilized a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the forward electricity rates relative to current rates, with all other variables held constant. For the foreign 
currency cash flow hedges, we utilized a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the AUD and CAD foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on AUD and CAD market rates in effect at September 30, 2024. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement would result in an approximate decrease in the fair value of the Cadia PPA cash flow hedge and the foreign currency cash flow hedges of $39 and $213 at September 30, 2024, respectively.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. We mitigate credit risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of the counterparties.

Market Liquidity Risk

Market liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing an offsetting position. Under the terms of our trading agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately settle outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of customary events of default such as covenant breaches, including financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. We further mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of our derivatives over time.

ITEM 4.       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

During the fiscal period covered by this report, the Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as amended). Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
On November 6, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Newcrest Mining Limited (“Newcrest”) which operated under its own set of systems and internal controls. Beginning in 2024, the Company transitioned certain Newcrest processes to the Company’s internal control processes and added other internal controls over significant processes specific to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumes as a result of the acquisition, and to post-acquisition activities, including internal controls associated with the valuation of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company will continue the process of integrating internal controls over financial reporting for Newcrest and plans to incorporate Newcrest in the evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024.
There were no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(1)The total number of shares purchased (and the average price paid per share) reflects: (i) shares purchased pursuant to the repurchase program described in (2) below; and (ii) shares delivered to the Company from stock awards held by employees upon vesting for the purpose of covering the recipients’ tax withholding obligations, totaling 31,906 shares, 387 shares, and 1,329 shares for the fiscal months of July, August, and September 2024, respectively. Subsequent to the end of the covered period, the Company repurchased 5,626,345 additional shares at an average price of $53.76 per share pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan for a total amount of $750 repurchased as of the date of filing under the February 2024 stock repurchase program described in (2) below.
(2)In February 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of outstanding common stock to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock award vesting and to provide returns to shareholders, provided that the aggregate value of shares of common stock repurchased does not exceed $1,000. The program will expire after 24 months (in February 2026). In October 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $2,000 stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of outstanding common stock. The program will expire after 24 months (in October 2026). The programs will be executed at the Company's discretion. The repurchase programs may be discontinued at any time, and the program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares of its common stock or to repurchase the full authorized amount during the authorization period. Consequently, the Board of Directors may revise or terminate such share repurchase authorization in the future.

ITEM 3.       DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.

None.

ITEM 4.       MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.

At Newmont, safety is a core value, and we strive for superior performance. Our health and safety management system, which includes detailed standards and procedures for safe production, addresses topics such as employee training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation and program auditing. In addition to strong leadership and involvement from all levels of the organization, these programs and procedures form the cornerstone of safety at Newmont, ensuring that employees are provided a safe and healthy environment and are intended to reduce workplace accidents, incidents and losses, comply with all mining-related regulations and provide support for both regulators and the industry to improve mine safety.
In addition, we have established our “Rapid Response” crisis management process to mitigate and prevent the escalation of adverse consequences if existing risk management controls fail, particularly if an incident may have the potential to seriously impact the safety of employees, the community or the environment. This process provides appropriate support to an affected site to complement their technical response to an incident, so as to reduce the impact by considering the environmental, strategic, legal, financial and public image aspects of the incident, to ensure communications are being carried out in accordance with legal and ethical requirements and to identify actions in addition to those addressing the immediate hazards. 
The health and safety of our people and our host communities is paramount. The operation of our U.S. based mine is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”). MSHA inspects our mine on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, MSHA 
significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also increased in recent years.
Newmont is required to report certain mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, and that required information is included in Exhibit 95 and is incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report. It is noted that the Nevada mines owned by Nevada Gold Mines LLC, a joint venture between the Company (38.5%) and Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”) (61.5%), are not included in the Company’s Exhibit 95 mine safety disclosure reporting as such sites are operated by our joint venture partner, Barrick.

ITEM 5.       OTHER INFORMATION.


Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans

Our directors and executive officers may purchase or sell shares of our common stock in the market from time to time, including pursuant to equity trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act and in compliance with guidelines specified by the Company’s stock trading standard. In accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and the Company’s insider trading policy, directors, officers and certain employees who, at such time, are not in possession of material non-public information about the Company are permitted to enter into written plans that pre-establish amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Under the Company’s stock trading standard, the first trade made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan may take place no earlier than 90 days after adoption of the trading plan. Under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the director or executive officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from them. The use of these trading plans permits asset diversification as well as financial and tax planning. Our directors and executive officers also may buy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material nonpublic information, subject to compliance with SEC rules, the terms of our stock trading standard and holding requirements. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the following directors and executive officers adopted or terminated Rule 10b5-1 trading plans intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c):

On August 30, 2024, Natascha Viljoen, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan. Ms. Viljoen’s Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan has a term of 7 months and provides for the sale of up to 45,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the plan. The adoption of such 10b5-1 Trading Plan occurred during an open insider trading window and complied with the Company’s standards on insider trading.

On September 3, 2024, Bruce Brook, a Director, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan. Mr. Brook’s Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan has a term of 16 months and provides for the sale of up to 24,933 shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the plan. The adoption of such 10b5-1 Trading Plan occurred during an open insider trading window and complied with the Company’s standards on insider trading.
