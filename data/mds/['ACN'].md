1. Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 12, 2023. 
The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2024.

Allowance for Credit Losses—Client Receivables and Contract Assets 

As of May 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $25,155 and $26,343, respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets.

Investments

All available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values).
Our non-current investments are as follows:
|    |                                                      |              |         |                 |         |    |         |
|---:|:-----------------------------------------------------|:-------------|:--------|:----------------|:--------|:---|:--------|

|  2 | Equity method investments                            | $            | 22,202  |                 |         | $  | 23,985  |
|  3 | Investments without readily determinable fair values | 209,079      |         |                 | 173,458 |    |         |
|  4 | Total non-current investments                        | $            | 231,281 |                 |         | $  | 197,443 |
For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of Other income (expense), net.
|    |                     |                                                                                                                                        |

Business Optimization

During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated actions to streamline our operations, transform our non-billable corporate functions and consolidate our office space to reduce costs. We recorded $1.1 billion in fiscal 2023 related to these actions and expect to record approximately $450 million in fiscal 2024 for a total of $1.5 billion, primarily related to employee severance. The actual amount and timing of severance and other personnel costs are dependent in part upon local country consultation processes and regulations and may differ from our current expectations and estimates.
Total business optimization costs by reportable operating segment for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were as follows:

|    |                                   |                    |         |                   |         |              |         |              |    |         |    |         |

(1)Effective September 1, 2023, we revised the reporting of our geographic markets for the movement of our Middle East and Africa market units from Growth Markets to Europe, and the Europe market is now referred to as our EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) geographic market. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.

New Accounting Pronouncements

On November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires entities to enhance disclosures regarding their segments, including significant segment expenses. The ASU will be effective beginning with our annual fiscal 2025 financial statements and requires a retrospective method upon adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our segment disclosures.
On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The ASU will be effective beginning with our annual fiscal 2026 financial statements and allows for adoption on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option. We are in the process of assessing the impacts and method of adoption. This ASU will impact our income tax disclosures, but not our Consolidated Financial Statements.

2. Revenues


Disaggregation of Revenue 


See Note 12 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. 


Remaining Performance Obligations 

We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $29 billion and $26 billion as of May 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 35% of our remaining performance obligations as of May 31, 2024 as revenue in fiscal 2024, an additional 37% in fiscal 2025, and the balance thereafter.

Contract Estimates 

Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023.

Contract Balances 

Deferred transition revenues were $621,251 and $653,954 as of May 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $834,045 and $851,972 as of May 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred transition costs are recoverable under the contract in the event of early termination and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues):

Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the nine months ended May 31, 2024 were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. 
Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2024 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023 were $2.6 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022 were $2.7 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.

(1)Diluted earnings per share assumes the exchange of all Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. The income effect does not take into account “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests - other,” since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. 
(2)The weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the calculation of diluted earnings per share excludes an immaterial amount of shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units because their effects were antidilutive.

8. Financial Instruments 


Derivatives

In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. 

Cash Flow Hedges 

For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next twelve months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Other Derivatives 

Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $57,232 and $103,568 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2024, respectively, and net losses of $72,091 and $94,351 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. 

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 

The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: 
|    |                               |              |            |                 |        |    |            |

We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows:

9. Borrowings and Indebtedness 

As of May 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, we had total outstanding debt of $1,678,903 and $147,903, respectively. 
As of May 31, 2024, we had the following borrowing facilities:
|    |                                                                                |                   |           |
|---:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------|:----------|
|  1 |                                                                                | Credit Facilities |           |
|  2 | Syndicated loan facility (1)                                                   | $                 | 5,500,000 |
|  3 | Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities (2) | 1,945,719         |           |
|  4 | Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit (3)                        | 275,676           |           |
|  5 | Total                                                                          | $                 | 7,721,395 |
(1)On May 14, 2024, we replaced our $3,000,000 syndicated 5-year credit facility with a new $5,500,000 syndicated credit facility maturing on May 14, 2029. This facility provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general corporate capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit and short-term commercial paper. Borrowings under this facility will accrue interest at the applicable risk-free rate plus a spread. We are in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of May 31, 2024, we had $1,606,900 of commercial paper outstanding (excluding unamortized discounts), and backed by this facility, with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 5.4%. As of August 31, 2023, we had $100,000 of commercial paper outstanding backed by our $3,000,000 syndicated 5-year credit facility, with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 5.4%.
(2)We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of May 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, we had no borrowings under these facilities. 
(3)We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of May 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, we had no borrowings under these various facilities.
We had an aggregate of $1,172,422 and $1,080,819 of letters of credit outstanding and $1,606,900 (excluding unamortized discounts) and $100,000 of commercial paper outstanding as of May 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. The amount of letters of credit and commercial paper outstanding reduces the available borrowing capacity under the facilities described above.

10. Income Taxes

We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs.
Our effective tax rates for the three months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 were 25.4% and 22.2%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2024 was primarily due to the tax impact in the prior year from an investment gain and higher expense from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities. Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 were 22.6% and 22.1%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 was primarily due to the tax impact in the prior year from an investment gain.

11. Commitments and Contingencies 


Indemnifications and Guarantees 

In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. 
As of May 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $2,192,000 and $1,793,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $59,000 and $51,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
As of May 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of $1,654,531 and $1,294,653, respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.
To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. 

Legal Contingencies

As of May 31, 2024, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, except as otherwise noted below, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On May 3, 2022, the court issued an order granting in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which we appealed. On August 17, 2023, the appeals court vacated the class certification and remanded the case to the district court for consideration of, among other things, the class action waiver signed by Starwood customer plaintiffs. On November 29, 2023, the district court reinstated the classes previously certified by the court in May 2022. We are appealing the district court's decision. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
After Accenture Federal Services (“AFS”) made a voluntary disclosure to the U.S. government, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) initiated a civil and criminal investigation concerning whether one or more employees provided inaccurate submissions to an assessor who was evaluating on behalf of the U.S. government an AFS service offering and whether the service offering fully implemented required federal security controls. AFS is responding to an administrative subpoena and cooperating with DOJ’s investigation. This matter could subject us to adverse consequences as described under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023 – “Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment”. We cannot at this time determine when or how this matter will be resolved or estimate the cost or range of costs that are reasonably likely to be incurred in connection with this matter.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 


The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. 

We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2024” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2024. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. 
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. 

Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “aspires,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook,” “goal,” “target,” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not limited to those identified below.

Business Risks

•Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. 
•Our business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. 
•If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
•We face legal, reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks. 
•The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. 
•Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. 
•If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key ecosystem partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Financial Risks

•Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels. 
•Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
•Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
•Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. 

Operational Risks

•As a result of our geographically diverse operations and strategy to continue to grow in key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
•We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

•Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. 
•Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.
•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. 
•If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected.
•We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

|  2 | ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q | Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations |


Overview

Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy & Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific and Latin America). We combine our strength in technology and leadership in cloud, data and AI with unmatched industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world’s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services—creating tangible value at speed and scale. As announced on June 11, 2024, effective September 1, 2024, our Latin America market unit will move from Growth Markets to North America. With this change, North America will become The Americas market and Growth Markets will become the Asia Pacific market.
Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business. These conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending, particularly for smaller contracts with a shorter duration and for our consulting services. Clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue over a longer period.

Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and increased 1% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Growth Markets and slight in North America, partially offset by a modest decline in EMEA. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Health & Public Service and modest in Resources and Products, partially offset by a decline in Financial Services and a slight decline in Communications, Media & Technology. Revenue growth in local currency was solid in managed services, partially offset by a slight decline in consulting. The business environment is competitive, and we continue to experience lower pricing across the business. We define pricing as contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.
In our consulting business, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 3% in U.S. dollars and 1% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decline in consulting revenue in local currency for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was driven by a decline in EMEA, partially offset by solid growth in Growth Markets and modest growth in North America. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. While we continue to experience demand for these services, we are seeing a slower pace and level of client spending, especially for smaller contracts with a shorter duration.
In our managed services business, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Managed services revenue growth in local currency for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was driven by very strong growth in Growth Markets, modest growth in EMEA and slight growth in North America. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and cybersecurity-as-a-service. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through technology, data and AI, and leveraging our digital platforms and talent to drive productivity and operational cost savings.
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. While a significant portion of our revenues are in U.S. dollars, the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. There was minimal currency translation impact for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2023. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2024, we estimate that our full fiscal 2024 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 0.7% lower than our revenue growth in local currency.

Utilization for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 92%, compared to 91% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 750,000 as of May 31, 2024, compared to approximately 732,000 as of May 31, 2023. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects people added in connection with acquisitions and hiring for specific skills.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 14%, up from 13% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand.

In addition, we adjust compensation to provide market relevant pay based on the skills of our people and locations where we operate. We also consider a variety of factors, including the macroeconomic environment, in making our decisions around pay and benefits. We strive to adjust pricing as well as drive cost and delivery efficiencies, such as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology, to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin and contract profitability.
Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees.

We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large managed services contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, managed services bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.
Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased $369 million, or 3%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 84.0% from 85.8% during this period. Operating expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 increased $19 million compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.1% from 85.7% during this period.
The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs such as facilities, technology and travel. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.
Operating expenses by category are as follows:

Cost of Services

Cost of services for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased $67 million, or 1%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 66.6% during this period. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 33.4% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 as lower labor costs were offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel.
Cost of services for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 increased $89 million over the nine months ended May 31, 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 67.4% from 67.7% during this period. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 increased to 32.6% compared to 32.3% during the nine months ended May 31, 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel compared to the same period in fiscal 2023.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased $12 million, or 1%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.6% compared to 10.5% during this period. Sales and marketing expense for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 increased $239 million, or 5%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2023, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.5% compared to 10.1% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 was due to higher selling and other business development costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2023.

General and Administrative Costs

General and administrative costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased $44 million, or 4%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.3% from 6.5% during this period. General and administrative costs for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 decreased $51 million, or 2%, from the nine months ended May 31, 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.5% from 6.7% during this period.

Business Optimization Costs

During the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, we recorded business optimization costs of $77 million and $347 million, respectively, primarily for employee severance. During the nine months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded business optimization costs of $332 million and $591 million, respectively, primarily for employee severance.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We have presented operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or "adjusted" basis excluding the business optimization costs recorded in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, and, with respect to effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share, the impact of an investment gain recorded in fiscal 2023, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior periods. While we believe that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating our operations, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Operating Income and Operating Margin 

Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows:

(1)Effective September 1, 2023, we revised the reporting of our geographic markets for the movement of our Middle East and Africa market units from Growth Markets to Europe, and the Europe market is now referred to as our EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) geographic market. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.
Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased $272 million, or 12%, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 16.0%, compared with 14.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Operating income for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 increased $345 million, or 5%, compared with the nine months ended May 31, 2023. Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 was 14.9%, compared with 14.3% for the nine months ended May 31, 2023.

Geographic Markets

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2024 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates where significant, for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2024 compared with the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023:

North America

•Three Months. Operating income increased primarily due to lower business optimization costs and lower labor costs, partially offset by a decline in consulting contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs.
•Nine Months. Operating income increased primarily due to lower business optimization costs and lower labor costs, partially offset by a decline in consulting contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs.

EMEA

•Three Months. Operating income increased primarily due to lower business optimization costs and lower labor costs, partially offset by declines in consulting contract profitability and consulting revenues in local currency. 
•Nine Months. Operating income increased primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates which resulted in an increase in U.S. dollar revenues, and lower labor costs, partially offset by declines in consulting revenues in local currency and consulting contract profitability. 

Growth Markets

•Three Months. Operating income increased primarily due to lower business optimization costs and revenue growth in local currency, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates which resulted in a decline in U.S. dollar revenues.    
•Nine Months. Operating income decreased as revenue growth in local currency and lower business optimization costs were more than offset by lower contract profitability and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates which resulted in a decline in U.S. dollar revenues.

Interest Income

Interest income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $54 million, a decrease of $28 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Interest income for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 was $221 million, an increase of $44 million over the nine months ended May 31, 2023. The decrease for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to lower cash balances compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 was primarily due to higher interest rates compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2023.

Other Income (Expense), net

During the three and nine months ended May 31, 2024, Other income (expense), net decreased $221 million and $197 million from the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023, respectively, primarily due to lower gains on investments.

Income Tax Expense

The effective tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023 were 25.4% and 22.2%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to the tax impact in the prior year from an investment gain and higher expense from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 were 22.6% and 22.1%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2024 was primarily due to the tax impact in the prior year from an investment gain.

Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
Operating activities: The $373 million decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher net income.
Investing activities: The $4,259 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
Financing activities: The $530 million increase in financing cash flows was primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings, partially offset by increases in the net purchases of shares and cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note 7 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”
We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 
Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. 

Borrowing Facilities 

For information about borrowing facilities, see Note 9 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”

(1)We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. 
(2)During the nine months ended May 31, 2024, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.

|  2 | ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q | Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations |

We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2024. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. 
To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 11 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”

(1)Average price paid per share reflects the total cash outlay for the period, divided by the number of shares acquired, including those acquired by purchase or redemption for cash and any acquired by means of employee forfeiture. 
(2)Since August 2001, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized and periodically confirmed a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we purchased 4,094,066 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under this program for an aggregate price of $1,312 million. The open-market purchase program does not have an expiration date.

Since August 2001 and as of May 31, 2024, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized an aggregate of $50.1 billion for share purchases and redemptions by Accenture plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. 
(4)During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Accenture purchased 195,030 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in transactions unrelated to publicly announced share plans or programs. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.
