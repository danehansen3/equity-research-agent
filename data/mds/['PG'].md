THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries ("the Company," "Procter & Gamble," "P&G," "we" or "our") should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. We have prepared these statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial information. Note that certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. In the opinion of management, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results.

2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” This guidance requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 and our interim periods within the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. The guidance will require additional disclosures in the Segment Information footnote, but will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This guidance requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disclosures of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures. 
No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

3. Segment Information

Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of:

The Procter & Gamble Company 7


Identifiable intangible assets at September 30, 2024, were comprised of:
|    |                                           |                       |        |                          |    |    |         |
|---:|:------------------------------------------|:----------------------|:-------|:-------------------------|:---|:---|:--------|
|  1 |                                           | Gross Carrying Amount |        | Accumulated Amortization |    |    |         |
|  2 | Intangible assets with determinable lives | $                     | 9,107  |                          |    | $  | (6,700) |
|  3 | Intangible assets with indefinite lives   | 19,646                |        |                          | —  |    |         |
|  4 | Total identifiable intangible assets      | $                     | 28,754 |                          |    | $  | (6,700) |
Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $83 and $87, respectively. 
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values.
As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was impaired during the year ended June 30, 2024. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion, which was equivalent to the estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023.
While we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is susceptible to further impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a further impairment charge.
The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates. 
Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximate expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. 
The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. 
The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.

8 The Procter & Gamble Company


We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2023, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our short-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rate, which may result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

5. Earnings Per Share 

Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other share-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock.
Net earnings per common share were calculated as follows:|    |                                                                           |                                 |       |      |         |    |       |

7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements

As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. Except for the impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset discussed in Note 4, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.
Cash equivalents were $10.7 billion and $8.0 billion as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company had no other material investments in debt or equity securities during the periods presented.
The fair value of long-term debt was $29.0 billion and $27.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($3.9 billion and $3.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.

The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $12.6 billion and $11.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in notional balance of the derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges is primarily driven by the Company's decision to leverage favorable interest rate spreads in the foreign currency swap market.
Derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. Derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 
Certain of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a liability position was $559 and $307 as of

The gains on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships are fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Interest expense. The gains/(losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A).

9. Commitments and Contingencies


Litigation

We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our 
Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.



The Procter & Gamble Company 11


counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Income Tax Uncertainties

The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 30–40 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the timing and ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Based on information currently available, we do not anticipate over the next 12-month period any significant audit activity concluding related to uncertain tax positions for which we have existing accrued liabilities. 

Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.


10. Supplier Finance Programs

The Company has an ongoing program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers consistent with market practices. The Company also supports a Supply Chain Finance program (“SCF”) with several global financial institutions. Under SCF, the Company maintains an accounts payable system to facilitate participating suppliers' ability to sell receivables from the Company to a SCF bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their sales of receivables arrangements directly with the respective SCF bank. The Company is not party to those agreements, but the SCF banks allow the suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. Under this model, this arrangement generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier chooses to participate in SCF, the supplier selects which individual Company invoices to sell to the SCF bank. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier’s decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The Company does not provide any form of guarantee under these financing arrangements. Our payment terms for suppliers under this program generally range from 60 to 180 days. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in Accounts payable was approximately $5.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and $5.6 billion as of June 30, 2024.

11. Restructuring Program

The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually. Consistent with our historical policies for restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges will be funded by and included within Corporate for management and segment reporting.
In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company started a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed this limited market portfolio restructuring with the substantial liquidation of its operations in Argentina and recorded approximately $0.8 billion after tax of incremental charges, comprised primarily of non-cash charges for accumulated foreign currency translation losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). The total incremental restructuring charges incurred under the program beginning in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, through the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $1.2 billion after tax.
For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred total before tax charges of $886 including $41 in Costs of products sold, $54 in SG&A and $791 in Other non-operating income/(expense). 
Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

Separation Costs 

Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that are primarily voluntary and the amounts calculated are based on salary levels and past service periods.

Asset-Related Costs 

Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation for manufacturing consolidations. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal. These assets are written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. 

Other Costs

Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan. Such charges include accumulated foreign currency translation losses, asset removal and termination of contracts related to Enterprise Market portfolio restructuring.

Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures

The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. 
The MD&A is organized in the following sections:
•Overview

•Summary of Results – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024


•Economic Conditions and Uncertainties


•Results of Operations – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024


•Segment Results – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024


•Liquidity and Capital Resources


•Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP

Throughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, consisting of organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.
Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter to date market share through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.

OVERVIEW

P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.

(1)    Effective July 1, 2024, the Beauty reportable business segment separated Skin and Personal Care into individual operating segments, Skin Care and Personal Care. This transition included separation of the management team, strategic decision-making, innovation plans, financial targets, budgets and management reporting.

Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS


Limited Market Portfolio Restructuring

In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company started a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed this limited market portfolio restructuring with the substantial liquidation of its operations in Argentina and recorded incremental restructuring charges of approximately $0.8 billion after tax, comprised primarily of non-cash charges for accumulated foreign currency translation losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). The total incremental restructuring charges incurred under the program beginning in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, through the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $1.2 billion after tax.
Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, resulting charges were funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Restructuring charges above the normal ongoing level of restructuring costs are

reported as non-core charges. For more details on the restructuring program, refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


SUMMARY OF RESULTS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024

The following are highlights of results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus the three months ended September 30, 2023:

•Net sales decreased 1% to $21.7 billion versus the prior year period. Net sales increased 2% in Health Care, 1% in Fabric & Home Care and decreased 5% in Beauty and 2% in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Net sales in Grooming were unchanged. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 2%. Organic sales increased 4% in Health Care, 3% in Grooming and Fabric & Home Care and decreased 2% in Beauty. Organic sales in Baby, Feminine & Family Care were unchanged.

•Net earnings were $4.0 billion, a decrease of $569 million, or 12%, versus the prior year period due primarily to higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina. 
•Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $4.0 billion, a decrease of $562 million, or 12%, versus the prior year period. 
•Diluted EPS decreased 12% to $1.61 due to the decrease in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes incremental restructuring charges, increased 5% to $1.93.
•Operating cash flow was $4.3 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act, was $3.9 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is defined as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings excluding a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina, was 82%. 

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments due to economic, political and social instabilities, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, foreign exchange and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 and less than 2% of net assets as of June 30, 2024. 
Foreign Exchange. We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the US dollar, which have negatively impacted net sales, net earnings and cash flows. In response to the devaluation of foreign currencies (including those deemed highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.
Commodities and Supply Chain. Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution operations can lead to increased costs. Legal or regulatory requirements and sustainability initiatives may result in increased costs. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may negatively impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.
Government Policies. We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on "Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy”. Government controls such as currency exchanges, pricing

and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements can also impact our financial performance.

Net Sales

Net sales for the quarter decreased 1% to $21.7 billion as increased pricing of 1% was more than fully offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 1% and rounding impacts. Unit volume and mix had a neutral impact on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 2% and organic volume increased 1%.
The following table summarizes key drivers of the change in net sales by reportable segment:

Operating Costs

Gross margin increased 10 basis points to 52.1% of net sales for the quarter. The increase in gross margin was due to:
•170 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings and
•30 basis points of increase due to higher pricing.
These impacts were partially offset by:

The Procter & Gamble Company 17


•90 basis points of higher commodity costs,
•60 basis points of decline from unfavorable product mix including the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand and 
•40 basis points of product and packaging investments.
Total SG&A spending decreased 2% to $5.5 billion versus the prior year period due to a decrease in other operating expenses. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 25.4% due to a decrease in other operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points as the increase in marketing spending was partially offset by productivity savings. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales was unchanged as increased productivity savings were offset by an increase in overhead spending and foreign exchange impacts. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points due primarily to higher foreign exchange transactional charges in the prior year period. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 60 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. 
Operating margin increased 30 basis points to 26.7% due to the increase in gross margin and the decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, as discussed above. Operating income increased $30 million, or 1%, to $5.8 billion for the quarter as the decrease in net sales was more than offset by the increase in operating margin, the components of which are discussed above. 

Non-Operating Expenses and Income

Interest expense was $238 million for the quarter, an increase of $13 million versus the prior year period. Interest income was $135 million for the quarter, an increase of $7 million versus the prior year period. Other non-operating income/(expense) was $(554) million, which is a decrease of $686 million versus the prior year period due primarily to a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 22.4%, compared to 21.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven by a 300 basis-point increase due primarily to the charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina, partially offset by a 160 basis-point decrease due to higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation and a decrease driven by favorable geographic mix impacts.

Net Earnings

Net earnings decreased $569 million, or 12%, to $4.0 billion due primarily to the decrease in other non-operating income/(expense) discussed above. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of approximately $61 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $562 million, or 12%, to $4.0 billion for the quarter. Diluted EPS decreased 12% to $1.61 versus the prior year period due to the decrease in net earnings.

Net earnings decreased 1% to $1.1 billion as the decrease in net sales was partially offset by a 20 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to a slight increase in gross margin and a lower effective tax rate. Gross margin increased primarily due to increased productivity savings partially offset by higher commodity costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was unchanged as an increase in overhead spending was offset by higher foreign exchange transactional charges in the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate was driven by favorable geographic mix.

Corporate

Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.
For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Corporate net sales increased $19 million to $163 million due to an increase in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased $539 million to a loss of $707 million for the quarter due primarily to incremental restructuring charges.

LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES


Operating Activities

Operating cash flow was $4.3 billion fiscal year to date, a decrease of $602 million versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain/loss on sale of assets), generated $5.8 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $1.5 billion of cash in the period primarily driven by the payment of prior fiscal year-end incentive compensation accruals, reduction in postretirement benefit accruals and current portion of the transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act. Days sales outstanding were flat and Days inventory on hand increased one day.

Investing Activities

Investing activities used $1.1 billion of cash fiscal year to date primarily driven by capital expenditures and the settlement of net investment hedges.

Financing Activities

Financing activities used $0.6 billion of net cash fiscal year to date, mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases, partially offset by a net debt increase and the impact of stock options and other. 
As of September 30, 2024, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $9.0 billion. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.

MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP

In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.
Organic sales growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.

Adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.

Adjusted free cash flow productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.

Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted EPS excluding items that are not judged by management to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:
•Incremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company started a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed this limited market portfolio restructuring with the substantial liquidation of its operations in Argentina. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.
We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.
