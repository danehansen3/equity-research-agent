|  1 | FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS |


CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and can often be identified by terms and phrases that include “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “continue,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “plan,” “project,” “predict,” “will,” “potential,” “forecast,” “target,” “guidance,” “outlook” or other similar terminology. Various factors may cause actual results to be materially different than the suggested outcomes within forward-looking statements; accordingly, there is no assurance that such results will be realized. These factors include, but are not limited to:
◦The ability to implement our business strategy, including our carbon emission reduction goals;
◦State, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives, including costs of compliance with existing and future environmental requirements, including those related to climate change, as well as rulings that affect cost and investment recovery or have an impact on rate structures or market prices;
◦The extent and timing of costs and liabilities to comply with federal and state laws, regulations and legal requirements related to coal ash remediation, including amounts for required closure of certain ash impoundments, are uncertain and difficult to estimate;
◦The ability to timely recover eligible costs, including amounts associated with coal ash impoundment retirement obligations, asset retirement and construction costs related to carbon emissions reductions, and costs related to significant weather events, and to earn an adequate return on investment through rate case proceedings and the regulatory process;
◦The costs of decommissioning nuclear facilities could prove to be more extensive than amounts estimated and all costs may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process;
◦The impact of extraordinary external events, such as the pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19, and their collateral consequences, including the disruption of global supply chains or the economic activity in our service territories;
◦Costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims;
◦Industrial, commercial and residential growth or decline in service territories or customer bases resulting from sustained downturns of the economy, storm damage, reduced customer usage due to cost pressures from inflation or fuel costs, and the economic health of our service territories or variations in customer usage patterns, including energy efficiency efforts, natural gas building and appliance electrification, and use of alternative energy sources, such as self-generation and distributed generation technologies;
◦Federal and state regulations, laws and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of energy efficiency measures, natural gas electrification, and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could result in a reduced number of customers, excess generation resources as well as stranded costs;

◦Advancements in technology;

◦Additional competition in electric and natural gas markets and continued industry consolidation;
◦The influence of weather and other natural phenomena on operations, financial position, and cash flows, including the economic, operational and other effects of severe storms, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes and tornadoes, including extreme weather associated with climate change;
◦Changing investor, customer and other stakeholder expectations and demands including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns and costs related thereto;
◦The ability to successfully operate electric generating facilities and deliver electricity to customers including direct or indirect effects to the Company resulting from an incident that affects the United States electric grid or generating resources;
◦Operational interruptions to our natural gas distribution and transmission activities;
◦The availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply;
◦The impact on facilities and business from a terrorist or other attack, war, vandalism, cybersecurity threats, data security breaches, operational events, information technology failures or other catastrophic events, such as severe storms, fires, explosions, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences;

 1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION


BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all information and notes required by GAAP for annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements in Duke Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The information in these combined notes relates to each of the Duke Energy Registrants as noted in the Index to Combined Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. However, none of the registrants make any representations as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the subsidiaries of Duke Energy other than itself.

These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in the opinion of the respective companies’ management, reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of each of the Duke Energy Registrants. Amounts reported in Duke Energy’s interim Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and each of the Subsidiary Registrants’ interim Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income are not necessarily indicative of amounts expected for the respective annual periods due to effects of seasonal temperature variations on energy consumption, regulatory rulings, timing of maintenance on electric generating units, changes in mark-to-market valuations, changing commodity prices and other factors.
In preparing financial statements that conform to GAAP, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION


These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances, the accounts of the Duke Energy Registrants and subsidiaries or VIEs where the respective Duke Energy Registrants have control. See Note 13 for additional information on VIEs. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the Duke Energy Registrants’ proportionate share of certain jointly owned generation and transmission facilities.


Discontinued Operations

Duke Energy has elected to present cash flows of discontinued operations combined with cash flows of continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, the notes to these condensed consolidated financial statements exclude amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, net of tax on Duke Energy's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations includes amounts related to noncontrolling interests. A portion of Noncontrolling interests on Duke Energy's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets relates to discontinued operations for the periods presented. See Note 2 for discussion of discontinued operations related to the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups.

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST

Duke Energy maintains a controlling financial interest in certain less than wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, Duke Energy consolidates these subsidiaries and presents the third-party investors' portion of Duke Energy's net income (loss), net assets and comprehensive income (loss) as noncontrolling interest. Noncontrolling interest is included as a component of equity on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating agreements of Duke Energy's subsidiaries with noncontrolling interest allocate profit and loss based on their pro rata shares of the ownership interest in the respective subsidiary. Therefore, Duke Energy allocates net income or loss and other comprehensive income or loss of these subsidiaries to the owners based on their pro rata shares.

OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS

Duke Energy, through a nonregulated subsidiary, was the winner of the Carolina Long Bay offshore wind auction in May 2022 and recorded an asset of $150 million related to the arrangement in Other within Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The asset is recorded in the EU&I segment at historical cost and is subject to impairment testing should circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

Duke Energy has a voluntary supply chain finance program (the “program”) that allows Duke Energy suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from Duke Energy to a global financial institution at a rate that leverages Duke Energy’s credit rating and which may result in favorable terms compared to the rate available to the supplier on their own credit rating. Suppliers participating in the program determine at their sole discretion, which invoices they will sell to the financial institution. Suppliers’ decisions on which invoices are sold do not impact Duke Energy’s payment terms, which are based on commercial terms negotiated between Duke Energy and the supplier regardless of program participation. The commercial terms negotiated between Duke Energy and its suppliers are consistent regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the program. Duke Energy does not issue any guarantees with respect to the program and does not participate in negotiations between suppliers and the financial institution. Duke Energy does not have an economic interest in the supplier’s decision to participate in the program and receives no interest, fees or other benefit from the financial institution based on supplier participation in the program.

Other Sale-Related Matters

Duke Energy (Parent) and several Duke Energy renewables project companies, located in the ERCOT market, were named in several lawsuits arising out of Texas Storm Uri, which occurred in February 2021. The legal actions related to all but one of the project companies in this matter transferred to affiliates of Brookfield in conjunction with the transaction closing in October 2023. In May 2024, the remaining claim in the lawsuit was transferred to the buyer in connection with the sale of a portion of the remaining Commercial Renewables assets. See Note 5 for more information.
As part of the purchase and sale agreement for the distributed generation group, Duke Energy has agreed to retain certain guarantees, with expiration dates between 2029 through 2034, related to tax equity partners' assets and operations that will be disposed of via sale. Duke Energy has obtained certain guarantees from the buyers in regards to future performance obligations to assist in limiting Duke Energy's exposure under the retained guarantees. The fair value of the guarantees is immaterial as Duke Energy does not believe conditions are likely for performance under these guarantees.

4. REGULATORY MATTERS


RATE-RELATED INFORMATION

The NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC, IURC, PUCO, TPUC and KPSC approve rates for retail electric and natural gas services within their states. The FERC approves rates for electric sales to wholesale customers served under cost-based rates (excluding Ohio and Indiana), as well as sales of transmission service. The FERC also regulates certification and siting of new interstate natural gas pipeline projects. For open regulatory matters, unless otherwise noted, the Subsidiary Registrants and Duke Energy Kentucky cannot predict the outcome or ultimate resolution of their respective matters.
As discussed further below, the Subsidiary Registrants were impacted by significant storms in 2024. Each Subsidiary Registrant is responsible for the restoration of service within its respective service territory and the recovery of related storm costs, including financing costs and, as applicable, the replenishment of storm-related reserves. The Subsidiary Registrants are considering all available avenues to recover storm-related costs, including insurance recovery and the securitization for certain costs, where applicable. Total storm restoration costs across the Subsidiary Registrants, including capital expenditures, for hurricanes Helene, Debby and Milton are estimated to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.9 billion and are expected to primarily impact the following registrants:

|    |                       |                        |     |    |       |    |       |

|  4 | Duke Energy Florida   | 1,100                  |     | -  | 1,300 |    |       |

(a)    These estimates do not include amounts for rebuilding certain damaged infrastructure, as estimates of such costs are not yet available, and will change as restoration work is completed and additional information is received on actual costs incurred. Duke Energy Florida was the only jurisdiction materially impacted by Hurricane Milton.

Hurricane Helene

In late September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 storm and subsequently impacted all of Duke Energy's service territories as the storm moved inland, with the most severe damage occurring in the Duke Energy Florida territory and the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress territories in North Carolina and South Carolina. Approximately 3.5 million customers were impacted across Duke Energy's system. As of September 30, 2024, Duke Energy's restoration costs incurred, including capital of $112 million, were approximately $582 million (primarily $261 million, $51 million and $251 million for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively). Approximately $451 million of the operation and maintenance expenses are deferred in regulatory assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 (primarily $177 million, $34 million and $236 million for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively). Total storm restoration costs, including capital expenditures, for Duke Energy are currently estimated to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.9 billion (primarily $900 million to $1.1 billion for Duke Energy Carolinas, $300 million to $400 million for Duke Energy Progress and $300 million to $400 million for Duke Energy Florida). These estimates do not include amounts for rebuilding certain damaged infrastructure, as estimates of such costs are not yet available, and will change as restoration work is completed and additional information is received on actual costs incurred.

Hurricane Debby


In August 2024, Hurricane Debby made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 storm, impacting primarily the Duke Energy Florida territory as well as the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress territories in North Carolina and South Carolina. Approximately 700,000 customers were impacted across Duke Energy's system. As of September 30, 2024, Duke Energy's restoration costs incurred, including capital expenditures of $11 million, were approximately $150 million (primarily $45 million, $45 million and $60 million for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively). Approximately $90 million of the operation and maintenance expenses are deferred in regulatory assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 (primarily $23 million, $13 million and $54 million for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively). These estimates could change as additional information is received on actual costs incurred.


Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress


Nuclear Station Subsequent License Renewal


On June 7, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a subsequent license renewal (SLR) application for the Oconee Nuclear Station (ONS) with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to renew ONS’s operating license for an additional 20 years. The SLR would extend operations of the facility from 60 to 80 years. The current licenses for units 1 and 2 expire in 2033 and the license for unit 3 expires in 2034. By a Federal Register Notice dated July 28, 2021, the NRC provided a 60-day comment period for persons whose interest may be affected by the issuance of a subsequent renewed license for ONS to file a request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. On September 27, 2021, Beyond Nuclear and Sierra Club (Petitioners) filed a Hearing Request and Petition to Intervene (Hearing Request) and a Petition for Waiver. The Hearing Request proposed three contentions and claimed that Duke Energy Carolinas did not satisfy the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, or the NRC’s NEPA-implementing regulations. Following Duke Energy Carolinas' answer and the Petitioners' reply, on February 11, 2022, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) issued its decision on the Hearing Request and found that the Petitioners failed to establish that the proposed contentions are litigable. The ASLB also denied the Petitioners' Petition for Waiver and terminated the Hearing Request proceeding.

On February 24, 2022, the NRC issued a decision in the SLR appeal related to Florida Power and Light's Turkey Point nuclear generating station in Florida. The NRC ruled that the NRC’s license renewal Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) does not apply to SLR because the GEIS does not address SLR. The decision overturned a 2020 NRC decision that found the GEIS applies to SLR. Although Turkey Point is not owned or operated by a Duke Energy Registrant, the NRC’s order applies to all SLR applicants, including ONS. The NRC order also indicated no subsequent renewed licenses will be issued until the NRC staff has completed an adequate NEPA review for each application. On April 5, 2022, the NRC approved a 24-month rulemaking plan that will enable the NRC staff to complete an adequate NEPA review. Although an SLR applicant may wait until the rulemaking is completed, the NRC also noted that an applicant may submit a supplement to its environmental report providing information on environmental impacts during the SLR period prior to the rulemaking being completed. On November 7, 2022, Duke Energy Carolinas submitted a supplement to its environmental report addressing environmental impacts during the SLR period. On March 6, 2024, the NRC staff submitted the rulemaking, which included the updated GEIS, to the NRC. The NRC approved the publication of the final rule on May 16, 2024. The updated GEIS was finalized and published on August 1, 2024, and the final rule was issued on August 6, 2024.
On December 19, 2022, the NRC published a notice in the Federal Register that the NRC will conduct a limited scoping process to gather additional information necessary to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental impacts at ONS during the SLR period. The NRC received comments from the EPA and the Petitioners and these comments identify 18 potential impacts that should be considered by the NRC in the EIS, which include, but are not limited to, climate change and flooding, environmental justice, severe accidents and external events. On February 8, 2024, the NRC issued the Oconee site-specific draft EIS. The NRC and EPA published the notice for the public to submit comments on the ONS site-specific draft EIS. On April 29, 2024, the Petitioners filed a Hearing Request. The request proposed three contentions and claimed that the ONS site-specific draft EIS is inadequate to satisfy the requirements of NEPA and the NRC’s NEPA-implementing regulations. Duke Energy Carolinas provided responses to the proposed contentions by May 31, 2024, as ordered by the ASLB. On June 24, 2024, the ASLB convened a pre-hearing conference to obtain information and ask questions concerning the admissibility of the Petitioners' contentions. On August 29, 2024, the ASLB issued a protective order to protect Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI) that is identified as Critical Energy/Electrical Infrastructure Information. On October 18, 2024, the ASLB indicated that it plans to issue a decision on contention admissibility by December 18, 2024. The NRC's issuance of the final EIS is pending the ASLB's decision.

On December 19, 2022, the NRC issued the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for the safety portion of the SLR application. The NRC determined Duke Energy Carolinas met the requirements of the applicable regulations and identified actions that have been taken or will be taken to manage the effects of aging and address time-limited analyses. Duke Energy Carolinas and the NRC met with the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) on February 2, 2023, to discuss issues regarding the SER and SLR application. On February 25, 2023, the ACRS issued a report to the NRC on the safety aspects of the ONS SLR application, which concluded that the established programs and commitments made by Duke Energy Carolinas to manage age-related degradation provide confidence that ONS can be operated in accordance with its current licensing basis for the subsequent period of extended operation without undue risk to the health and safety of the public and the SLR application for ONS should be approved.
Although the NRC’s GEIS applicability decision has delayed completion of the SLR proceeding, Duke Energy Carolinas does not believe it changes the probability that the ONS subsequent renewed licenses will ultimately be issued, although Duke Energy Carolinas cannot guarantee the outcome of the license application process.
Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress intend to seek renewal of operating licenses and 20-year license extensions for all of their nuclear stations.

Duke Energy Carolinas


2023 North Carolina Rate Case

On January 19, 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a performance-based regulation (PBR) application with the NCUC to request an increase in base rate retail revenues. The PBR application included a multiyear rate plan (MYRP) to recover projected capital investments during the three-year MYRP period. In addition to the MYRP, the PBR application included an Earnings Sharing Mechanism, Residential Decoupling Mechanism and Performance Incentive Mechanisms (PIMS) as required by HB 951. The application as originally filed requested an overall retail revenue increase of $501 million in Year 1, $172 million in Year 2 and $150 million in Year 3, for a combined total of $823 million, or 15.7%, by early 2026. The rate increase is driven primarily by transmission and distribution investments since the last rate case and projected in the MYRP, as well as investments in energy storage and solar assets included in the MYRP consistent with the Carolinas Carbon Plan (Carbon Plan).
On August 22, 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas filed with the NCUC a partial settlement with the Public Staff in connection with its PBR application. The partial settlement included, among other things, agreement on a substantial portion of the North Carolina retail rate base for the historic base case of approximately $19.5 billion and all of the capital projects and related costs to be included in the three-year MYRP, including $4.6 billion (North Carolina retail allocation) projected to go in service over the MYRP period. Additionally, the partial settlement included agreement, with certain adjustments, on depreciation rates, the recovery of grid improvement plan costs and PIMs, Tracking Metrics and the Residential Decoupling Mechanism under the PBR application. On August 28, 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas filed with the NCUC a second partial settlement with the Public Staff resolving additional issues, including the future treatment of nuclear production tax credits related to the Inflation Reduction Act, through a stand-alone rider that will provide the benefits to customers beginning January 1, 2025. As a result of the partial settlements, Duke Energy Carolinas recognized pretax charges of $59 million within Impairment of assets and other charges, which primarily related to certain COVID-19 deferred costs, and $8 million within Operations, maintenance and other, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
On December 15, 2023, the NCUC issued an order approving Duke Energy Carolinas' PBR application, as modified by the partial settlements and the order, including an overall retail revenue increase of $436 million in Year 1, $174 million in Year 2 and $158 million in Year 3, for a combined total of $768 million. The order established an ROE of 10.1% based upon an equity ratio of 53% and approved, with certain adjustments, depreciation rates and the recovery of grid improvement plan costs and certain deferred COVID-related costs. Additionally, the Residential Decoupling Mechanism and PIMs were approved as requested under the PBR application and revised by the partial settlements. Duke Energy Carolinas implemented interim rates, subject to refund, on September 1, 2023. New revised Year 1 rates and the residential decoupling were implemented on January 15, 2024. 
On February 13, 2024, a number of parties filed Notices of Appeal of the December 15, 2023, NCUC order. Notices of Appeal were filed by the Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates (CIGFUR) III, a collection of various electric membership corporations (collectively, the EMCs), and the North Carolina Attorney General’s Office (the AGO). CIGFUR III and the EMCs appealed the interclass subsidy reduction percentage and the Transmission Cost Allocation stipulation. In addition, CIGFUR III appealed the NCUC’s elimination of the equal percentage fuel cost allocation methodology. The AGO appealed several issues including the authorized ROE and certain rate design and accounting matters. On March 1, 2024, Carolina Utility Customers Association, Inc. appealed several issues, including the authorized ROE and certain rate design and accounting matters. In July 2024, the Supreme Court of North Carolina consolidated the appeal with the parallel appeal of the NCUC's order regarding the Duke Energy Progress PBR application. The briefing is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 2024. Duke Energy Carolinas anticipates a decision to be issued by the third quarter of 2025.

2024 South Carolina Rate Case

On January 4, 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a rate case with the PSCSC to request an increase in base rate retail revenues. On May 17, 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas and the Office of Regulatory Staff, as well as other consumer, environmental, and industrial intervening parties, filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Settlement resolving all issues in the base rate proceeding. The major components of the settlement include a $240 million annual customer rate increase, prior to a reduction from the accelerated return to customers of federal unprotected Property, Plant and Equipment related EDIT of $84 million annually over the first two years. The stipulation includes an ROE of 9.94% with an equity ratio of 51.21% and resolves recovery of the Company's continued investments in the grid, its new corporate headquarters and environmental compliance costs. The PSCSC held a hearing on May 20, 2024, to consider evidence supporting the stipulation. On July 3, 2024, the PSCSC issued its final order approving an increase in base rates and approving nearly all components of the Agreement and Stipulation of Settlement. The order revised recovery of certain environmental compliance costs, the only provision of the settlement agreement not fully approved by the PSCSC. As a result, Duke Energy Carolinas recognized pretax charges of $33 million within Impairment of assets and other charges, $2 million within Operations, maintenance and other, partially offset by an $11 million reduction in Interest expense, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Based upon the order, after accelerating the EDIT giveback to customers, the net rate increase is $150 million annually for the first two years. Revised customer rates were effective August 1, 2024, and are based upon a South Carolina retail rate base of $7.4 billion.

Marshall Combustion Turbines CPCN

On March 14, 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas filed with the NCUC an application to construct and operate two hydrogen-capable advanced-class simple-cycle combustion turbines (CTs) at the site of the existing Marshall Steam Station. The two new CTs – totaling approximately 850 MW – will enable the retirement of Marshall coal units 1 and 2 and provide incremental capacity to support system capacity needs and expanded flexibility to support integration of renewables. Pending regulatory approvals, construction is planned to start in 2026, and the CTs are targeted to be placed into service by the end of 2028. As part of the application, Duke Energy Carolinas noted that Construction Work in Progress for the proposed facility will accrue AFUDC and will not be in rate base, resulting in no impact on Duke Energy Carolinas' North Carolina retail revenue requirement during the construction period. The 2029 North Carolina retail revenue requirement for the proposed facility is estimated to be $104 million, representing an approximate average retail rate increase of 2.2% across all classes. The expert witness hearing concluded on August 6, 2024. An order is expected no later than December 31, 2024, in parallel with the NCUC’s order in the Carolinas Resource Plan proceeding.

Duke Energy Progress


2022 North Carolina Rate Case

On October 6, 2022, Duke Energy Progress filed a PBR application with the NCUC to request an increase in base rate retail revenues. The rate request before the NCUC included an MYRP to recover projected capital investments during the three-year MYRP period. In addition to the MYRP, the PBR application included an Earnings Sharing Mechanism, Residential Decoupling Mechanism and PIMs as required by HB 951. The overall retail revenue increase as originally filed would have been $326 million in Year 1, $151 million in Year 2 and $138 million in Year 3, for a combined total of $615 million, by late 2025. The rate increase is driven primarily by transmission and distribution investments since the last rate case and projected in the MYRP, as well as investments in energy storage and solar assets included in the MYRP consistent with the Carbon Plan.
On April 26, 2023, Duke Energy Progress filed with the NCUC a partial settlement with Public Staff, which included agreement on many aspects of Duke Energy Progress' three-year MYRP proposal. In May 2023, CIGFUR II joined this partial settlement and Public Staff and CIGFUR II filed a separate settlement reaching agreement on PIMs, Tracking Metrics and the Residential Decoupling Mechanism under the PBR application. 
On August 18, 2023, the NCUC issued an order approving Duke Energy Progress' PBR application, as modified by the partial settlements and the order, including an overall retail revenue increase of $233 million in Year 1, $126 million in Year 2 and $135 million in Year 3, for a combined total of $494 million. Key aspects of the order include the approval of North Carolina retail rate base for the historic base case of approximately $12.2 billion and capital projects and related costs to be included in the three-year MYRP, including $3.5 billion (North Carolina retail allocation) projected to go in service over the MYRP period. The order established an ROE of 9.8% based upon an equity ratio of 53% and approved, with certain adjustments, depreciation rates and the recovery of grid improvement plan costs and certain deferred COVID-related costs. Additionally, the Residential Decoupling Mechanism and PIMs were approved as requested under the PBR application and revised by the partial settlements. As a result of the order, Duke Energy Progress recognized pretax charges of $28 million within Impairment of assets and other charges, which primarily related to certain COVID-19 deferred costs, and $8 million within Operations, maintenance and other, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Duke Energy Progress implemented interim rates, subject to refund, on June 1, 2023, and implemented revised Year 1 rates and the residential decoupling on October 1, 2023.
On October 17, 2023, CIGFUR II and Haywood Electric Membership Corporation each filed a Notice of Appeal of the August 18, 2023 NCUC order. Both parties are appealing certain matters that do not impact the overall revenue requirement in the rate case. Specifically, they appealed the interclass subsidy reduction percentage, and CIGFUR II also appealed the Customer Assistance Program and the equal percentage fuel cost allocation methodology. On November 6, 2023, the AGO filed a Notice of Cross Appeal of the NCUC's determination regarding the exclusion of electric vehicle revenue from the residential decoupling mechanism. On November 9, 2023, Duke Energy Progress, the Public Staff, CIGFUR II, and a number of other parties reached a settlement pursuant to which CIGFUR II agreed not to pursue its appeal of the Customer Assistance Program. In July 2024, the Supreme Court of North Carolina consolidated the appeal with the parallel appeal of the NCUC's order regarding the Duke Energy Carolinas PBR application. The briefing is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 2024. Duke Energy Progress anticipates a decision to be issued by the third quarter of 2025.

2023 South Carolina Storm Securitization

On May 31, 2023, Duke Energy Progress filed a petition with the PSCSC requesting authorization for the financing of Duke Energy Progress' storm recovery costs through securitization due to storm recovery activities required as a result of the following storms: Pax, Ulysses, Matthew, Florence, Michael, Dorian, Izzy and Jasper. On September 8, 2023, Duke Energy Progress filed a comprehensive settlement agreement with all parties on all cost recovery issues raised in the storm securitization proceeding.
The evidentiary hearing occurred in early September 2023. On September 20, 2023, the PSCSC approved the comprehensive settlement agreement and on October 13, 2023, the PSCSC issued its financing order. The storm recovery bonds of $177 million were issued by Duke Energy Progress on April 25, 2024. Duke Energy Progress implemented storm recovery charges effective May 1, 2024.

As part of the application, Duke Energy Progress noted that the recovery of Construction Work in Progress during the construction period for the proposed facility may be pursued in a future rate case. The 2029 North Carolina retail revenue requirement for the proposed facility is estimated to be $98 million, representing an approximate average retail rate increase of 2.6% across all classes. The expert witness hearing concluded on August 8, 2024. An order is expected no later than December 31, 2024, in parallel with the NCUC’s order in the Carolinas Resource Plan proceeding.

Duke Energy Florida


2021 Settlement Agreement


On January 14, 2021, Duke Energy Florida filed a Settlement Agreement (the “2021 Settlement”) with the FPSC. The parties to the 2021 Settlement include Duke Energy Florida, the Office of Public Counsel (OPC), the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, White Springs Agricultural Chemicals, Inc. d/b/a PCS Phosphate and NUCOR Steel Florida, Inc. (collectively, the “Parties”).

Pursuant to the 2021 Settlement, the Parties agreed to a base rate stay-out provision that expires year-end 2024; however, Duke Energy Florida is allowed an increase to its base rates of an incremental $67 million in 2022, $49 million in 2023 and $79 million in 2024, subject to adjustment in the event of tax reform during the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Parties also agreed to an ROE band of 8.85% to 10.85% with a midpoint of 9.85% based upon an equity ratio of 53%. The ROE band can be increased by 25 basis points if the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate increases 50 basis points or more over a six-month period in which case the midpoint ROE would rise from 9.85% to 10.10%. On July 25, 2022, this provision was triggered. Duke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on August 12, 2022, to increase the ROE effective August 2022 with a base rate increase effective January 1, 2023. The FPSC approved this request on October 4, 2022. The 2021 Settlement Agreement also provided that Duke Energy Florida will be able to retain $173 million of the expected Department of Energy (DOE) award from its lawsuit to recover spent nuclear fuel to mitigate customer rates over the term of the 2021 Settlement. In return, Duke Energy Florida is permitted to recognize the $173 million into earnings through the approved settlement period. Duke Energy Florida settled the DOE lawsuit and received payment of approximately $180 million on June 15, 2022, of which the retail portion was approximately $154 million. The 2021 Settlement authorizes Duke Energy Florida to collect the difference between $173 million and the $154 million retail portion of the amount received through the capacity cost recovery clause. As of September 30, 2024, Duke Energy Florida has recognized $165 million (pretax) into earnings, including $8 million and $31 million recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and $24 million and $94 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The remaining $8 million is expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2024.
The 2021 Settlement also contained a provision to recover or flow back the effects of tax law changes. As a result of the IRA enacted on August 16, 2022, Duke Energy Florida is eligible for PTCs associated with solar facilities placed in service beginning in January 2022. Duke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on October 17, 2022, to reduce base rates effective January 1, 2023, by $56 million to flow back the expected 2023 PTCs and to flow back the expected 2022 PTCs via an adjustment to the capacity cost recovery clause. On December 14, 2022, the FPSC issued an order approving Duke Energy Florida's petition.
In addition to these terms, the 2021 Settlement contained provisions related to the accelerated depreciation of Crystal River Units 4-5, the approval of approximately $1 billion in future investments in new cost-effective solar power, the implementation of a new Electric Vehicle Charging Station Program and the deferral and recovery of costs in connection with the implementation of Duke Energy Florida’s Vision Florida program, which explores various emerging non-carbon emitting generation technology, distributed technologies and resiliency projects, among other things. The 2021 Settlement also resolved remaining unrecovered storm costs for Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Dorian. 
The FPSC approved the 2021 Settlement on May 4, 2021, issuing an order on June 4, 2021. Revised customer rates became effective January 1, 2022, with subsequent base rate increases effective January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024.

Clean Energy Connection

On July 1, 2020, Duke Energy Florida petitioned the FPSC for approval of a voluntary solar program consisting of 10 new solar generating facilities with combined capacity of approximately 750 MW. The program allows participants to support cost-effective solar development in Florida by paying a subscription fee based on per kilowatt subscriptions and receiving a credit on their bill based on the actual generation associated with their portion of the solar portfolio. The estimated cost of the 10 new solar generation facilities is approximately $1 billion and the projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2024. This investment is included in base rates offset by the revenue from the subscription fees and the credits will be included for recovery in the fuel cost recovery clause. The FPSC approved the program in January 2021.
On February 24, 2021, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) filed a notice of appeal of the FPSC’s order approving the Clean Energy Connection to the Supreme Court of Florida. The Supreme Court of Florida heard oral arguments in the appeal on February 9, 2022. On May 27, 2022, the Supreme Court of Florida issued an order remanding the case back to the FPSC so that the FPSC can amend its order to better address some of the arguments raised by LULAC. On September 23, 2022, the FPSC issued a revised order and submitted it on September 26, 2022, to the Supreme Court of Florida. The Supreme Court of Florida requested that the parties file supplemental briefs regarding the revised order, which were filed February 6, 2023. LULAC has filed a request for Oral Argument on the issues discussed in the supplemental briefs, but the court has yet to rule on that request. The FPSC approval order remains in effect pending the outcome of the appeal.

Storm Protection Plan

On April 11, 2022, Duke Energy Florida filed a Storm Protection Plan for approval with the FPSC. The plan, which covers investments for the 2023-2032 time frame, reflects approximately $7 billion of capital investment in transmission and distribution meant to strengthen its infrastructure, reduce outage times associated with extreme weather events, reduce restoration costs and improve overall service reliability. The evidentiary hearing began on August 2, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the FPSC voted to approve Duke Energy Florida’s plan with one modification to remove the transmission loop radially fed program, representing a reduction of approximately $80 million over the 10-year period starting in 2025. On December 9, 2022, the OPC filed a notice of appeal of this order to the Florida Supreme Court. The OPC's initial brief was filed on April 18, 2023. Duke Energy Florida filed its answer brief on July 17, 2023. The OPC's reply brief was filed on October 16, 2023. The Florida Supreme Court heard oral arguments on February 7, 2024 and the parties await the court's decision.

Hurricanes Ian and Idalia 

On September 28, 2022, much of Duke Energy Florida’s service territory was impacted by Hurricane Ian, which caused significant damage resulting in more than 1.1 million outages. After depleting any existing storm reserves, which were approximately $107 million before Hurricane Ian, Duke Energy Florida is permitted to petition the FPSC for recovery of additional incremental operation and maintenance costs resulting from the storm and to replenish the retail customer storm reserve to approximately $132 million. Duke Energy Florida filed its petition for cost recovery of various storms, including Hurricane Ian, and replenishment of the storm reserve on January 23, 2023, seeking recovery of $442 million, for recovery over 12 months beginning with the first billing cycle in April 2023. On March 7, 2023, the FPSC approved this request for interim recovery, subject to refund, and ordered Duke Energy Florida to file documentation of the total actual storm costs, once known. Duke Energy Florida filed documentation evidencing its total actual storm costs of $431 million on September 29, 2023. The FPSC approved the prudence of these costs at a final hearing on May 21, 2024.
On August 30, 2023, Hurricane Idalia made landfall on Florida’s gulf coast, causing damage and impacting more than 200,000 customers across Duke Energy Florida's service territory. On October 16, 2023, Duke Energy Florida requested to combine the $92 million retail portion of the deferred estimated Hurricane Idalia costs with $74 million of costs projected to be collected after December 31, 2023, under the existing approved storm cost recovery and storm surcharge. This $74 million of costs relates primarily to the approved ongoing replenishment of the storm reserves. At its December 5, 2023 Agenda Conference, the FPSC approved recovery of the total $166 million over 12 months beginning with its first billing cycle in January 2024, replacing the previously approved storm cost recovery and storm surcharge, and ordered Duke Energy Florida to file documentation of the total actual Idalia-related storm costs, once known. Revised rates were effective January 1, 2024. Duke Energy Florida filed documentation evidencing its total Idalia actual storm costs of $98 million on September 23, 2024.

2024 Florida Rate Case

On April 2, 2024, Duke Energy Florida filed a formal request for new base rates with the FPSC. Duke Energy Florida proposed a three-year rate plan that would begin in January 2025, once its current base rate settlement agreement concludes at the end of 2024. Duke Energy Florida proposed multiyear rate increases that use the projected 12-month periods ending December 31, 2025, 2026, and 2027 as the test years, with adjusted rates to be effective with the first billing period of January 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively.
On July 15, 2024, Duke Energy Florida filed a settlement agreement with the FPSC. The parties to the settlement include Duke Energy Florida, the Office of Public Counsel and other intervening parties. Pursuant to the settlement, the parties agreed to a base rate stay-out provision that expires year-end 2027; however, Duke Energy Florida is allowed an increase to its base rates in 2025 and 2026, as well as utilization of certain tax benefits in lieu of a revenue increase in 2027. Additionally, revenue increases related to solar investments will be recovered via the Solar Base Rate Adjustment mechanism. The parties also agreed to an ROE band of 9.3% to 11.3% with a midpoint of 10.3% with an equity ratio of 53%. The agreement provides for $203 million and $59 million in base rate increases in 2025 and 2026, respectively, as well as increases associated with investments in 12 new solar facilities as they come online, estimated at $12 million, $71 million and $58 million in 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively. On August 21, 2024, the FPSC approved the settlement agreement without modification.

Hurricane Milton

In October 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida as a Category 3 storm, impacting more than 1 million customers in the Duke Energy Florida territory. Total storm restoration costs, including capital expenditures, for Duke Energy Florida are currently estimated to be in the range of $700 million to $850 million. These estimates do not include amounts for rebuilding certain damaged infrastructure, as estimates of such costs are not yet available, and will change as restoration work is completed and additional information is received on actual costs incurred.
Duke Energy Florida has certain existing storm-reserve regulatory liability amounts which will be applied to recovery of the 2024 storm costs (including for Hurricanes Helene and Debby as discussed above) which totaled approximately $100 million as of September 30, 2024.

Duke Energy Ohio


Duke Energy Ohio Electric Base Rate Case

Duke Energy Ohio filed with the PUCO an electric distribution base rate case application on October 1, 2021, with supporting testimony filed on October 15, 2021, requesting an increase in electric distribution base rates of approximately $55 million. On September 19, 2022, Duke Energy Ohio filed a Stipulation and Recommendation with the PUCO, which includes an increase in overall electric distribution base rates of approximately $23 million with an equity ratio of 50.5% and an ROE of 9.5%. The stipulation is among all but one party to the proceeding. The PUCO issued an order on December 14, 2022, approving the Stipulation without material modification. Rates went into effect on January 3, 2023. The Ohio Consumers' Counsel filed an application for rehearing on January 13, 2023, arguing the Stipulation was unreasonable, discriminatory, and denied OCC due process. On March 20, 2024, the PUCO issued its Second Entry on Rehearing, denying OCC's rehearing application. The deadline for OCC to seek an appeal has expired and the matter is now closed.

Duke Energy Ohio Natural Gas Base Rate Case

Duke Energy Ohio filed with the PUCO a natural gas base rate case application on June 30, 2022, with supporting testimony filed on July 14, 2022, requesting an increase in natural gas base rates of approximately $49 million. The drivers for this case are capital invested since Duke Energy Ohio's last natural gas base rate case in 2012. Duke Energy Ohio also sought to adjust the caps on its CEP rider. On April 28, 2023, Duke Energy Ohio filed a stipulation with all parties to the case except the OCC. In the stipulation, the parties agreed to approximately $32 million in revenue increases with an equity ratio of 52.32% and an ROE of 9.6%, and adjustments to the CEP Rider caps. The stipulation was opposed by the OCC at an evidentiary hearing that concluded on May 24, 2023. On November 1, 2023, PUCO issued an order approving the stipulation as filed. New rates went into effect November 1, 2023. On December 1, 2023, the OCC filed an application for rehearing. On December 13, 2023, the PUCO granted OCC's application for rehearing for further consideration of issues raised. As a result of a Supreme Court of Ohio decision regarding procedural issues related to applications for rehearing, PUCO denied OCC’s rehearing request. On October 25, 2024, the OCC filed its Notice of Appeal with the Ohio Supreme Court.

Duke Energy Ohio Electric Security Plan

On April 1, 2024, Duke Energy Ohio filed with the PUCO a request for an Electric Security Plan (ESP). The ESP application proposes a three-year term from June 1, 2025, through May 31, 2028, and includes continuation of market-based customer rates through competitive procurement processes for generation and continuation and expansion of existing rider mechanisms. Duke Energy Ohio is proposing a new rider mechanism relating to electric distribution infrastructure modernization programs, which may be enabled by and partially funded through federal or state funding opportunities, future battery storage projects, and two proposed electric vehicle programs. Additional proposed new rider mechanisms are related to solar for all investments for low-income and disadvantaged communities, low-income senior citizen bill assistance, and energy efficiency and demand-side management programs. At the request of Duke Energy Ohio, PUCO suspended the evidentiary hearing scheduled for November 13, 2024, in light of ongoing settlement discussions.

Duke Energy Kentucky Electric Base Rate Case

On December 1, 2022, Duke Energy Kentucky filed a rate case with the KPSC requesting an annualized increase in electric base rates of approximately $75 million. The request for rate increase was driven by capital investments to strengthen the electricity generation and delivery systems along with adjusted depreciation rates for the East Bend and Woodsdale Combustion Turbine (CT) generation stations. Duke Energy Kentucky also requested approval for new programs and tariff updates, including a voluntary community-based renewable subscription program and two electric vehicle charging programs. The KPSC issued an order on October 12, 2023, including a $48 million increase in base revenues, an ROE of 9.75% for electric base rates and 9.65% for electric riders and an equity ratio of 52.145%. New rates went into effect October 13, 2023. The Company's request to align the depreciation rates of East Bend with a 2035 retirement date was denied and the KPSC ordered depreciation rates with a 2041 retirement date for the unit. The KPSC did approve the request to align the depreciation rates of Woodsdale CT with a 2040 retirement date and denied the voluntary community-based renewable subscription program and the two electric vehicle charging programs.
On November 1, 2023, Duke Energy Kentucky filed for rehearing requesting certain matters be reconsidered by the KPSC. On November 21, 2023, KPSC granted in part and denied in part the Company's request for rehearing. On February 15, 2024, the KPSC issued a briefing schedule for the rehearing process. The briefing concluded on April 1, 2024, and the matter was submitted for decision on April 2, 2024. On July 1, 2024, the KPSC issued its final order on rehearing, ruling in Duke Energy Kentucky's favor on nearly all issues. However, the KPSC ordered Duke Energy Kentucky to refund alleged over collections since the KPSC's October 12, 2023, order. On July 10, 2024, the KPSC issued an order correcting the base fuel rate used to calculate new base rates in its July 1, 2024, order and its calculation of Duke Energy Kentucky's Street Lighting Rate. New rates were implemented in August 2024.
On December 14, 2023, Duke Energy Kentucky filed an appeal with the Franklin County Circuit Court on certain matters for which the KPSC denied rehearing, specifically as it relates to including decommissioning costs in depreciation rates for East Bend and Woodsdale. Duke Energy Kentucky filed its initial brief in June 2024. Appellee briefs were filed September 24, 2024, and Duke Energy Kentucky's reply brief is due November 8, 2024.

Duke Energy Indiana


Indiana Coal Ash Recovery

In Duke Energy Indiana’s 2019 rate case, the IURC opened a subdocket for post-2018 coal ash related expenditures. Duke Energy Indiana filed testimony on April 15, 2020, in the coal ash subdocket requesting recovery for the post-2018 coal ash basin closure costs for plans that have been approved by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) as well as continuing deferral, with carrying costs, on the balance. On November 3, 2021, the IURC issued an order allowing recovery for post-2018 coal ash basin closure costs for the plans that have been approved by IDEM, as well as continuing deferral, with carrying costs, on the balance. The OUCC and the Duke Industrial Group appealed. The Indiana Court of Appeals issued its opinion on February 21, 2023, reversing the IURC's order to the extent that it allowed Duke Energy Indiana to recover federally mandated costs incurred prior to the IURC's November 3, 2021 order. In addition, the court found that any costs incurred pre-petition to determine federally mandated compliance options were not specifically authorized by the statute and should also be disallowed.
In the second quarter of 2023, Duke Energy Indiana filed its proposal to remove from rates certain costs incurred prior to the IURC's November 3, 2021 order date. On September 20, 2023, the IURC approved the Company's proposal to remove the costs from its rates and assessed simple interest of the refunds of 4.71%, beginning from when the costs were initially recovered from customers. Duke Energy Indiana seeks to recover the pre-order costs denied by the Indiana Court of Appeals and certain future coal ash closure costs as part of depreciation costs in the 2024 Indiana Rate Case.

|  1 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | REGULATORY MATTERS |

Duke Energy Indiana filed a new petition under the amended version of the federal mandate statute for additional post-2018 coal ash closure costs for the remaining basins not included in the Indiana coal ash recovery case from 2020. An evidentiary hearing was held on January 25, 2024. On May 8, 2024, the IURC issued a CPCN and approved these coal ash related compliance projects as federally mandated compliance projects. On June 7, 2024, the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana (CAC) filed a motion to appeal the IURC order granting the coal ash CPCN proceeding and approving the coal ash related compliance projects. CAC filed its appellant's brief on October 4, 2024. Appellees' briefs are due December 9, 2024.

TDSIC 2.0

On November 23, 2021, Duke Energy Indiana filed for approval of the Transmission, Distribution, Storage Improvement Charge 2.0 investment plan for 2023-2028 (TDSIC 2.0). On June 15, 2022, the IURC approved, without modification, TDSIC 2.0, which includes approximately $2 billion in transmission and distribution investments selected to improve customer reliability, harden and improve resiliency of the grid, enable expansion of renewable and distributed energy projects and encourage economic development. In addition, the IURC set up a subdocket to consider a targeted economic development project, which the IURC approved on March 2, 2022. On July 15, 2022, the OUCC filed a notice of appeal to the Indiana Court of Appeals in Duke Energy Indiana’s TDSIC 2.0 proceeding. An appellant brief was filed on October 28, 2022, and Duke Energy Indiana filed its responsive brief on December 28, 2022. The Indiana Court of Appeals issued its opinion on March 9, 2023, affirming the IURC’s order in its entirety. The Duke Industrial Group filed a petition to transfer to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Indiana Supreme Court granted transfer and held an oral argument on September 28, 2023, and the parties await the court's decision.

2024 Indiana Rate Case

On April 4, 2024, Duke Energy Indiana filed an application with the IURC for a rate increase of $492 million, representing an overall average bill increase of approximately 16.2%, which, if approved, would be added to retail customer bills in two steps, approximately 11.7% in 2025 and approximately 4.5% in 2026. Duke Energy Indiana requested an ROE of 10.5% with an equity ratio of 53%. The rate increase is driven by $1.6 billion in investments made since the last general rate case filed in 2019 in order to reliably serve customers, improve resiliency of the system, and advance environmental sustainability. An evidentiary hearing was completed on September 5, 2024, with briefing continuing until October 31, 2024. An order is anticipated by January 2025 with new rates effective in March 2025.

Piedmont


2024 North Carolina Rate Case

On April 1, 2024, Piedmont filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers. On September 13, 2024, Piedmont, the Public Staff and other intervening parties filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Settlement with the NCUC resolving all issues in the general rate case. The major components of the settlement include an overall average effective increase in net annual retail revenues of $88 million in the first year and $10 million of additional revenue after the first year. The settlement includes an ROE of 9.8% with an equity ratio of 52.3% and the addition of a rider mechanism for recovery of all pipeline integrity management operations and maintenance expenses. The settlement is subject to the review and approval of the NCUC. The evidentiary hearing concluded on September 18, 2024, and Piedmont implemented revised interim rates, subject to refund, November 1, 2024. An order is anticipated by January 2025.

5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES


ENVIRONMENTAL

The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time, imposing new obligations on the Duke Energy Registrants. The following environmental matters impact all Duke Energy Registrants.

Remediation Activities

In addition to AROs recorded as a result of various environmental regulations, the Duke Energy Registrants are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites. These include certain properties that are part of ongoing operations and sites formerly owned or used by Duke Energy entities. These sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring. Managed in conjunction with relevant federal, state and local agencies, remediation activities vary based on site conditions and location, remediation requirements, complexity and sharing of responsibility. If remediation activities involve joint and several liability provisions, strict liability, or cost recovery or contribution actions, the Duke Energy Registrants could potentially be held responsible for environmental impacts caused by other potentially responsible parties and may also benefit from insurance policies or contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs. Liabilities are recorded when losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. The total costs that may be incurred cannot be estimated because the extent of environmental impact, allocation among potentially responsible parties, remediation alternatives and/or regulatory decisions have not yet been determined at all sites. Additional costs associated with remediation activities are likely to be incurred in the future and could be significant. Costs are typically expensed as Operation, maintenance and other on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations unless regulatory recovery of the costs is deemed probable.

Additional losses in excess of recorded reserves that could be incurred for the stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring for environmental sites that have been evaluated at this time are not material.

LITIGATION

For open litigation, unless otherwise noted, Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants cannot predict the outcome or ultimate resolution of their respective matters.

Duke Energy


Texas Storm Uri Tort Litigation

Duke Energy (Parent), several Duke Energy renewables project companies, and others in the ERCOT market were named in multiple lawsuits arising out of Texas Storm Uri, which occurred in February 2021. These lawsuits seek recovery for property damage, personal injury and wrongful death allegedly caused by the power outages that plaintiffs claim were the collective failure of generators including Duke Energy entities, transmission and distribution operators (TDUs), retail energy providers, and all others, including ERCOT. The cases were consolidated into a Texas state court multidistrict litigation (MDL) proceeding for discovery and pre-trial motions. Five MDL cases were designated as lead cases in which motions to dismiss were filed and all other cases were stayed. 
On January 28, 2023, the court denied certain motions including those by the generator defendants and TDUs and granted others. The generators and TDUs filed separate petitions for Writ of Mandamus to the Texas Court of Appeals seeking to overturn the denials. The TDUs' petition, filed first, was accepted and oral argument was held on October 23, 2023. In the cases against the generators, plaintiffs have dismissed the claims against Duke Energy (Parent). However, before Duke Energy (Parent) was dismissed from all cases, on December 14, 2023, without argument, the Court of Appeals accepted mandamus of the generator defendants’ appeal, which includes all Duke Energy entities, and directed the MDL court to dismiss all claims. Plaintiffs filed their Petition for Reconsideration on January 29, 2024, and the generator defendants responded on May 6, 2024. Regardless of the outcome of any motion for reconsideration or appeal, claims against Duke Energy (Parent) will remain dismissed. In October 2023, in conjunction with the closing of the sale of the utility-scale solar and wind group, all but one of the project company lawsuits transferred to Brookfield. In May 2024, the remaining claim in the lawsuit was transferred to the buyer in connection with the sale of a portion of the remaining Commercial Renewables assets. See Note 2 for more information related to the sale of the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups.

Duke Energy Carolinas

NTE Carolinas II, LLC Litigation
In November 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas entered into a standard FERC large generator interconnection agreement (LGIA) with NTE Carolinas II, LLC (NTE), a company that proposed to build a combined-cycle natural gas plant in Rockingham County, North Carolina. On September 6, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a lawsuit in Mecklenburg County Superior Court against NTE for breach of contract, alleging that NTE's failure to pay benchmark payments for Duke Energy Carolinas' transmission system upgrades required under the interconnection agreement constituted a termination of the interconnection agreement. Duke Energy Carolinas sought a monetary judgment against NTE because NTE failed to make multiple milestone payments. The lawsuit was moved to federal court in North Carolina. NTE filed a motion to dismiss Duke Energy Carolinas’ complaint and brought counterclaims alleging anti-competitive conduct and violations of state and federal statutes. Duke Energy Carolinas filed a motion to dismiss NTE's counterclaims. Both NTE's and Duke Energy Carolinas' motions to dismiss were subsequently denied by the court.
On May 21, 2020, in response to a NTE petition challenging Duke Energy Carolinas' termination of the LGIA, FERC issued a ruling that 1) it has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a transmission provider may terminate an LGIA; 2) FERC approval is required to terminate a conforming LGIA if objected to by the interconnection customer; and 3) Duke Energy may not announce the termination of a conforming LGIA unless FERC has approved the termination. FERC's Office of Enforcement also initiated an investigation of Duke Energy Carolinas into matters pertaining to the LGIA. On April 6, 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas received notice from the FERC Office of Enforcement that they have closed their non-public investigation with no further action recommended.

|---:|:---------------------|:------------------------------|
|  1 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES |

Following completion of discovery, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a ruling in its favor as to some of its affirmative claims against NTE and to all of NTE’s counterclaims. On June 24, 2022, the court issued an order partially granting Duke Energy Carolinas' motion by dismissing NTE's counterclaims that Duke Energy Carolinas engaged in anti-competitive behavior in violation of state and federal statutes. On October 12, 2022, the parties executed a settlement agreement with respect to the remaining breach of contract claims in the litigation and a Stipulation of Dismissal was filed with the court on October 13, 2022. On November 11, 2022, NTE filed its Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit as to the district court's summary judgment ruling in Duke Energy Carolinas' favor on NTE's antitrust and unfair competition claims. Briefing on NTE's appeal was completed on June 30, 2023. Oral argument took place on May 7, 2024. On August 5, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings. On August 19, 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a petition for rehearing, which is fully briefed and awaiting the court's decision.

Asbestos-related Injuries and Damages Claims

Duke Energy Carolinas has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement related to asbestos exposure. These claims relate to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted on its electric generation plants prior to 1985.
Duke Energy Carolinas has recognized asbestos-related reserves of $402 million at September 30, 2024, and $423 million at December 31, 2023. These reserves are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These reserves are based on Duke Energy Carolinas' best estimate for current and future asbestos claims through 2044 and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. In light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer-term forecast, management does not believe they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after 2044 related to such potential claims. It is possible Duke Energy Carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves.
Duke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. Receivables for insurance recoveries were $539 million at September 30, 2024, and $572 million at December 31, 2023. These amounts are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets and Receivables within Current Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Duke Energy Carolinas believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating.
The reserve for credit losses for insurance receivables is $9 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, for both Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas. The insurance receivable is evaluated based on the risk of default and the historical losses, current conditions and expected conditions around collectability. Management evaluates the risk of default annually based on payment history, credit rating and changes in the risk of default from credit agencies.

Duke Energy Indiana


Coal Ash Insurance Coverage Litigation

In June 2022, Duke Energy Indiana filed a civil action in Indiana Superior Court against various insurance companies seeking declaratory relief with respect to insurance coverage for coal combustion residuals-related expenses and liabilities covered by third-party liability insurance policies. The insurance policies cover the 1969-1972 and 1984-1985 periods and provide third-party liability insurance for claims and suits alleging property damage, bodily injury and personal injury (or a combination thereof). A trial date has not yet been set. 
On June 30, 2023, Duke Energy Indiana and Associated Electric and Gas Insurance Services (AEGIS) reached a confidential settlement, the results of which were not material to Duke Energy, and as a result, AEGIS was dismissed from the litigation on July 13, 2023. Duke Energy Indiana has also reached confidential settlements with other various insurance companies, the results of which were not material. In June 2024, Duke Energy Indiana filed an amended complaint adding several additional insurance companies as defendants to the litigation and the court entered an order staying the litigation until January 22, 2025.

Other Litigation and Legal Proceedings

The Duke Energy Registrants are involved in other legal, tax and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve significant amounts. The Duke Energy Registrants believe the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material effect on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Reserves are classified on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities.

OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES


General

As part of their normal business, the Duke Energy Registrants are party to various financial guarantees, performance guarantees and other contractual commitments to extend guarantees of credit and other assistance to various subsidiaries, investees and other third parties. These guarantees involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not fully recognized on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and have uncapped maximum potential payments. However, the Duke Energy Registrants do not believe these guarantees will have a material effect on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In addition, the Duke Energy Registrants enter into various fixed-price, noncancelable commitments to purchase or sell power or natural gas, take-or-pay arrangements, transportation, or throughput agreements and other contracts that may or may not be recognized on their respective Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Some of these arrangements may be recognized at fair value on their respective Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets if such contracts meet the definition of a derivative and the NPNS exception does not apply. In most cases, the Duke Energy Registrants’ purchase obligation contracts contain provisions for price adjustments, minimum purchase levels and other financial commitments.

AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITIES


Master Credit Facility

In March 2024, Duke Energy extended the termination date of its existing $9 billion Master Credit Facility to March 2029. The Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, have borrowing capacity under the Master Credit Facility up to a specified sublimit for each borrower. Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower. The amount available under the Master Credit Facility has been reduced to backstop issuances of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder.

7. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

The Duke Energy Registrants record AROs when there is a legal obligation to incur retirement costs associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Actual costs incurred could be materially different from current estimates that form the basis of the recorded AROs. 
The following table presents the AROs recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

ARO Liability Rollforward

In April 2024, the EPA issued the 2024 CCR Rule under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule by establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities.
The following table presents the change in liability associated with AROs for the Duke Energy Registrants.

Duke Energy Ohio's Goodwill balance of $920 million, allocated $596 million to EU&I and $324 million to GU&I, is presented net of accumulated impairment charges of $216 million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.


Progress Energy

Progress Energy's Goodwill is included in the EU&I segment and there are no accumulated impairment charges.

Piedmont

Piedmont's Goodwill is included in the GU&I segment and there are no accumulated impairment charges.

Impairment Testing

Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont are required to perform an annual goodwill impairment test as of the same date each year and, accordingly, perform their annual impairment testing of goodwill as of August 31. Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont update their test between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As the fair value for Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont exceeded their respective carrying values at the date of the annual impairment analysis, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in the third quarter of 2024.

|  1 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS |

In addition to the amounts presented above, the Subsidiary Registrants have other affiliate transactions, including rental of office space, participation in a money pool arrangement, other operational transactions, such as pipeline lease arrangements, and their proportionate share of certain charged expenses. These transactions of the Subsidiary Registrants are incurred in the ordinary course of business and are eliminated in consolidation.
As discussed in Note 13, certain trade receivables were previously sold by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana to CRC, an affiliate formed by a subsidiary of Duke Energy. The proceeds obtained from the sales of receivables were largely cash but included a subordinated note from CRC for a portion of the purchase price. In March 2024, Duke Energy repaid all outstanding CRC borrowings and terminated the related CRC credit facility.

Intercompany Income Taxes

Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state and jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary Registrants have a tax sharing agreement with Duke Energy for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits. Income taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations. The following table includes the balance of intercompany income tax receivables and payables for the Subsidiary Registrants.

10. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

The Duke Energy Registrants use commodity, interest rate and foreign currency contracts to manage commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The primary use of commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against changes in the prices of electricity and natural gas. Piedmont enters into natural gas supply contracts to provide diversification, reliability and natural gas cost benefits to its customers. Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk associated with borrowings. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage risk related to foreign currency exchange rates on certain issuances of debt.
All derivative instruments not identified as NPNS are recorded at fair value as assets or liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral related to derivative instruments executed under master netting arrangements is offset against the collateralized derivatives on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash impacts of settled derivatives are recorded as operating activities or financing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the classification of the hedged transaction.

INTEREST RATE RISK

The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of their issuance or anticipated issuance of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Interest rate risk is managed by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring changes in interest rates. To manage risk associated with changes in interest rates, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into interest rate swaps, U.S. Treasury lock agreements and other financial contracts. In anticipation of certain fixed-rate debt issuances, a series of forward-starting interest rate swaps or Treasury locks may be executed to lock in components of current market interest rates. These instruments are later terminated prior to or upon the issuance of the corresponding debt.

Cash Flow Hedges

For a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to variable cash flows of a future transaction, referred to as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings once the future transaction impacts earnings. Amounts for interest rate contracts are reclassified to earnings as interest expense over the term of the related debt. Gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were not material. Duke Energy's interest rate derivatives designated as hedges include forward-starting interest rate swaps not accounted for under regulatory accounting.

Undesignated Contracts

Undesignated contracts primarily include contracts not designated as a hedge because they are accounted for under regulatory accounting or contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Duke Energy’s interest rate swaps for its regulated operations employ regulatory accounting. With regulatory accounting, the mark-to-market gains or losses on the swaps are deferred as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets, respectively. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment of the related costs in the ratemaking process. The accrual of interest on the swaps is recorded as Interest Expense on the Duke Energy Registrant's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the impact of changes in the prices of electricity purchased and sold in bulk power markets and natural gas purchases, including Piedmont's natural gas supply contracts. Exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors including the term of contracts, the liquidity of markets and delivery locations. To manage risk associated with commodity prices, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into long-term power purchase or sales contracts and long-term natural gas supply agreements.

Undesignated Contracts

Undesignated contracts primarily include contracts not designated as a hedge because they are accounted for under regulatory accounting or contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting.
For the Subsidiary Registrants, bulk power electricity and natural gas purchases flow through fuel adjustment clauses, formula-based contracts or other cost-sharing mechanisms. Differences between the costs included in rates and the incurred costs, including undesignated derivative contracts, are largely deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Piedmont policies allow for the use of financial instruments to hedge commodity price risks. The strategy and objective of these hedging programs are to use the financial instruments to reduce natural gas cost volatility for customers.

Volumes

The tables below include volumes of outstanding commodity derivatives. Amounts disclosed represent the absolute value of notional volumes of commodity contracts excluding NPNS. The Duke Energy Registrants have netted contractual amounts where offsetting purchase and sale contracts exist with identical delivery locations and times of delivery. Where all commodity positions are perfectly offset, no quantities are shown.

Fair Value Hedges

Derivatives related to existing fixed-rate securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the derivatives’ fair value gains or losses and hedged items’ fair value gains or losses are both recorded directly to earnings on the same income statement line item, including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S. currency exchange rates. Duke Energy has elected to exclude the cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of effectiveness in the fair value hedges of its foreign currency risk and record any difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded components and the amounts recognized in earnings as a component of other comprehensive income or loss.
The following table shows Duke Energy's outstanding derivatives related to foreign currency risk at September 30, 2024.

OBJECTIVE CREDIT CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain derivative contracts contain objective credit contingent features. These features include the requirement to post cash collateral or letters of credit if specific events occur, such as a credit rating downgrade below investment grade. The following tables show information with respect to derivative contracts that are in a net liability position and contain objective credit risk-related payment provisions.

11. INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

Duke Energy’s investments in debt and equity securities are primarily comprised of investments held in (i) the nuclear decommissioning trust funds (NDTF) at Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, (ii) the grantor trusts at Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana related to OPEB plans and (iii) Bison. The Duke Energy Registrants classify investments in debt securities as Available for Sale (AFS) and investments in equity securities as fair value through net income (FV-NI).
For investments in debt securities classified as AFS, the unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income until realized, at which time they are reported through net income. For investments in equity securities classified as FV-NI, both realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported through net income. Substantially all of Duke Energy’s investments in debt and equity securities qualify for regulatory accounting, and accordingly, all associated realized and unrealized gains and losses on these investments are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.
Duke Energy classifies the majority of investments in debt and equity securities as long term, unless otherwise noted.

Investment Trusts

The investments within the Investment Trusts are managed by independent investment managers with discretion to buy, sell and invest pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the investment manager agreements and trust agreements. The Duke Energy Registrants have limited oversight of the day-to-day management of these investments. As a result, the ability to hold investments in unrealized loss positions is outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants. Accordingly, all unrealized losses associated with debt securities within the Investment Trusts are recognized immediately and deferred to regulatory accounts where appropriate.

Other AFS Securities

Unrealized gains and losses on all other AFS securities are included in other comprehensive income until realized, unless it is determined the carrying value of an investment has a credit loss. The Duke Energy Registrants analyze all investment holdings each reporting period to determine whether a decline in fair value is related to a credit loss. If a credit loss exists, the unrealized credit loss is included in earnings. There were no material credit losses as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 

Other Investments amounts are recorded in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is the exchange price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value definition focuses on an exit price versus the acquisition cost. Fair value measurements use market data or assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs may be readily observable, corroborated by market data or generally unobservable. Valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A midmarket pricing convention (the midpoint price between bid and ask prices) is permitted for use as a practical expedient.
Fair value measurements are classified in three levels based on the fair value hierarchy as defined by GAAP. Certain investments are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. These investments are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The net asset value is derived based on the investment cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
Fair value accounting guidance permits entities to elect to measure certain financial instruments that are not required to be accounted for at fair value, such as equity method investments or the Company’s own debt, at fair value. The Duke Energy Registrants have not elected to record any of these items at fair value.
Valuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed below are as follows.
Investments in equity securities
The majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. Investments in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the quarter. Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. There was no after-hours market activity that was required to be reflected in the reported fair value measurements.

Most investments in debt securities are valued using Level 2 measurements because the valuations use interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. If the market for a particular fixed-income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3.
Commodity derivatives
Commodity derivatives with clearinghouses are classified as Level 1. Commodity derivatives with observable forward curves are classified as Level 2. If forward price curves are not observable for the full term of the contract and the unobservable period had more than an insignificant impact on the valuation, the commodity derivative is classified as Level 3. In isolation, increases (decreases) in natural gas forward prices result in favorable (unfavorable) fair value adjustments for natural gas purchase contracts; and increases (decreases) in electricity forward prices result in unfavorable (favorable) fair value adjustments for electricity sales contracts. Duke Energy regularly evaluates and validates pricing inputs used to estimate the fair value of certain commodity contracts by a market participant price verification procedure. This procedure provides a comparison of internal forward commodity curves to market participant generated curves.
Interest rate derivatives
Most over-the-counter interest rate contract derivatives are valued using financial models that utilize observable inputs for similar instruments and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward interest rate curves, notional amounts, interest rates and credit quality of the counterparties. 
Foreign currency derivatives
Most over-the-counter foreign currency derivatives are valued using financial models that utilize observable inputs for similar instruments and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward foreign currency rate curves, notional amounts, foreign currency rates and credit quality of the counterparties.
Other fair value considerations

(a)Book value of long-term debt includes $1.0 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, of net unamortized debt discount and premium of purchase accounting adjustments related to the mergers with Progress Energy and Piedmont that are excluded from fair value of long-term debt.
At both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, notes payable and commercial paper and nonrecourse notes payable of VIEs are not materially different from their carrying amounts because of the short-term nature of these instruments and/or because the stated rates approximate market rates.

13. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

CONSOLIDATED VIEs
The obligations of the consolidated VIEs discussed in the following paragraphs are nonrecourse to the Duke Energy Registrants. The registrants have no requirement to provide liquidity to, purchase assets of or guarantee performance of these VIEs unless noted in the following paragraphs.
No financial support was provided to any of the consolidated VIEs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the year ended December 31, 2023, or is expected to be provided in the future that was not previously contractually required.

Receivables Financing – DERF/DEPR/DEFR

DERF, DEPR and DEFR are bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively. DERF, DEPR and DEFR are wholly owned LLCs with separate legal existence from their parent companies, and their assets are not generally available to creditors of their parent companies. On a revolving basis, DERF, DEPR and DEFR buy certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity and related services from their parent companies.
DERF, DEPR and DEFR borrow amounts under credit facilities to buy these receivables. Borrowing availability from the credit facilities is limited to the amount of qualified receivables purchased, which generally exclude receivables past due more than a predetermined number of days and reserves for expected past-due balances. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligations is cash collections from the receivables. Amounts borrowed under the DERF, DEPR and DEFR credit facilities are reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as Current maturities of long-term debt.
The most significant activity that impacts the economic performance of DERF, DEPR and DEFR are the decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are considered the primary beneficiaries and consolidate DERF, DEPR and DEFR, respectively, as they make those decisions. 
In April 2024, Duke Energy Florida repaid all outstanding DEFR borrowings totaling $325 million and terminated the related DEFR credit facility. Additionally, Duke Energy Florida's related restricted receivables outstanding at DEFR at the time of termination totaled $459 million and were transferred back to Duke Energy Florida to be collected and reported as Receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Receivables Financing – CRC

CRC is a bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity indirectly owned by Duke Energy. On a revolving basis, CRC bought certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity, natural gas and related services from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. CRC then borrowed amounts under a credit facility to buy the receivables from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Borrowing availability from the credit facility was limited to the amount of qualified receivables sold to CRC, which generally excluded receivables past due more than a predetermined number of days and reserved for expected past-due balances. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligation was cash collections from the receivables.
The proceeds Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana received from the sale of receivables to CRC were approximately 75% cash and 25% in the form of a subordinated note from CRC. The subordinated note was a retained interest in the receivables sold. Depending on collection experience, additional equity infusions to CRC would be required by Duke Energy to maintain a minimum equity balance of $3 million.

CRC was considered a VIE because (i) equity capitalization was insufficient to support its operations, (ii) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity was not held by the equity holder and (iii) deficiencies in net worth of CRC were funded by Duke Energy. The most significant activities that impacted the economic performance of CRC were decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy was considered the primary beneficiary and consolidated CRC as it made these decisions. Neither Duke Energy Ohio nor Duke Energy Indiana consolidated CRC. 
In March 2024, Duke Energy repaid all outstanding CRC borrowings totaling $350 million and terminated the related CRC credit facility. Additionally, Duke Energy's related restricted receivables outstanding at CRC at the time of termination totaled $682 million, consisting of $316 million and $366 million of restricted receivables that were transferred back to Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio, respectively, to be collected and reported as Receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Nuclear Asset-Recovery Bonds

Duke Energy Florida Project Finance, LLC (DEFPF) is a bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of Duke Energy Florida. DEFPF was formed in 2016 for the sole purpose of issuing nuclear asset-recovery bonds to finance Duke Energy Florida's unrecovered regulatory asset related to Crystal River Unit 3. 
In 2016, DEFPF issued senior secured bonds and used the proceeds to acquire nuclear asset-recovery property from Duke Energy Florida. The nuclear asset-recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable nuclear asset-recovery charge from all Duke Energy Florida retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The nuclear asset-recovery bonds are secured by the nuclear asset-recovery property and cash collections from the nuclear asset-recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Florida.
DEFPF is considered a VIE primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. Duke Energy Florida has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE as described above and therefore Duke Energy Florida is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates DEFPF.

The following table summarizes the impact of DEFPF on Duke Energy Florida's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Duke Energy has investments in various joint ventures including pipeline and renewable natural gas projects. These entities are considered VIEs due to having insufficient equity to finance their own activities without subordinated financial support. Duke Energy does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of these VIEs and therefore does not consolidate these entities.

CRC


Amounts included in Receivables from affiliated companies in the above table for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana reflect their retained interest in receivables sold to CRC as of December 31, 2023.

14. REVENUE

Duke Energy earns substantially all of its revenues through its reportable segments, EU&I and GU&I.

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure

EU&I earns the majority of its revenues through retail and wholesale electric service through the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. Duke Energy generally provides retail and wholesale electric service customers with their full electric load requirements or with supplemental load requirements when the customer has other sources of electricity.

|  1 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | REVENUE |

The majority of wholesale revenues are full requirements contracts where the customers purchase the substantial majority of their energy needs and do not have a fixed quantity of contractually required energy or capacity. As such, related forecasted revenues are considered optional purchases. Supplemental requirements contracts that include contracted blocks of energy and capacity at contractually fixed prices have the following estimated remaining performance obligations:

Revenues for block sales are recognized monthly as energy is delivered and stand-ready service is provided, consistent with invoiced amounts and unbilled estimates.

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure

GU&I earns its revenue through retail and wholesale natural gas service through the transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas. Duke Energy generally provides retail and wholesale natural gas service customers with all natural gas load requirements. Additionally, while natural gas can be stored, substantially all natural gas provided by Duke Energy is consumed by customers simultaneously with receipt of delivery.
Fixed-capacity payments under long-term contracts for the GU&I segment include minimum margin contracts and supply arrangements with municipalities and power generation facilities. Revenues for related sales are recognized monthly as natural gas is delivered and stand-ready service is provided, consistent with invoiced amounts and unbilled estimates. Estimated remaining performance obligations are as follows:

Trade and other receivables are evaluated based on an estimate of the risk of loss over the life of the receivable and current and historical conditions using supportable assumptions. Management evaluates the risk of loss for trade and other receivables by comparing the historical write-off amounts to total revenue over a specified period. Historical loss rates are adjusted due to the impact of current conditions, as well as forecasted conditions over a reasonable time period. The calculated write-off rate can be applied to the receivable balance for which an established reserve does not already exist. Management reviews the assumptions and risk of loss periodically for trade and other receivables.

15. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to Duke Energy common stockholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities and accumulated preferred dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to Duke Energy common stockholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities and accumulated preferred dividends, by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock, such as equity forward sale agreements or convertible debt, were exercised or settled. Duke Energy applies the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion of the outstanding convertible notes on diluted EPS, if applicable. Duke Energy’s participating securities are restricted stock units that are entitled to dividends declared on Duke Energy common stock during the restricted stock unit’s vesting periods. Dividends declared on preferred stock are recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of net income to arrive at net income available to Duke Energy common stockholders. Dividends accumulated on preferred stock are an adjustment to net income used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.

Common Stock

In November 2022, Duke Energy filed a prospectus supplement and executed an Equity Distribution Agreement (EDA) under which it may sell up to $1.5 billion of its common stock through an at-the-market (ATM) offering program, including an equity forward sales component. Under the terms of the EDA, Duke Energy may issue and sell shares of common stock through September 2025.
The following table shows ATM equity issuances pursuant to forward contracts executed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

|  7 | Total   | 2,931,591     |                       |        |

The equity forwards require Duke Energy to either physically settle the transactions by issuing shares in exchange for net proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreements or net settle in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of cash or shares. The settlement alternatives are at Duke Energy's election. No amounts have or will be recorded in Duke Energy's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to the ATM offering until settlement of the equity forwards occurs, which is expected by December 31, 2024. The initial forward sale prices will be subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor and will decrease by other fixed amounts specified in the relevant forward sale agreements. Until settlement of the equity forwards, earnings per share dilution resulting from the agreements, if any, will be determined under the treasury stock method.

Preferred Stock

On September 16, 2024, Duke Energy redeemed all 1 million outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock for a redemption price of $1,000 per share or $1 billion in total. Following the redemption, dividends ceased to accrue on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, shares of the Series B Preferred Stock were no longer deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock terminated. In conjunction with the redemption, Duke Energy recorded $16 million in preferred stock redemption costs, calculated as the difference of $11 million between the carrying value on the redemption date of the Series B Preferred Stock and the total amount of consideration paid to redeem, and including the recognition of an excise tax liability under the IRA of $5 million. The preferred stock redemption costs were recorded as a reduction to Retained earnings on Duke Energy Corporations' Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Duke Energy uses a December 31 measurement date for its qualified non-contributory defined benefit retirement plan assets and obligations. However, because Duke Energy believes it is probable in 2024 that total lump-sum benefit payments for one of its defined benefit retirement plans will exceed the settlement threshold, which is defined as the sum of the service cost and interest cost on projected benefit obligation components of net periodic pension costs, Duke Energy remeasured the plan's assets and plan's projected benefit obligation as of September 30, 2024. The discount rate used for the September 30, 2024 remeasurement was 5.0% and the cash balance interest crediting rate was 4.0%. The interest rate for lump sum and annuity conversions was updated to reflect current market conditions. All other assumptions used for the September 30, 2024, remeasurement were consistent with the measurement as of December 31, 2023.

As a result of the remeasurement, Duke Energy recognized a remeasurement loss of $11 million, of which $10 million was recorded in Regulatory Assets within Other Noncurrent Assets and $1 million was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. The remeasurement loss, which represents a decrease in funded status of the plan, reflects an increase of $117 million in the fair value of the plan's assets and an increase of $128 million in the plan's projected benefit obligation.


As the result of settlement accounting, Duke Energy recognized settlement charges of $72 million, of which $60 million was recorded to Regulatory Assets within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and $12 million was recorded to Other Income and Expenses, net, within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as of September 30, 2024.

17. INCOME TAXES

On August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law. Among other provisions, the IRA created a new, zero-emission nuclear power PTC available for taxpayers beginning January 1, 2024. Through September 30, 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have recorded PTC deferred tax assets of approximately $325 million and $59 million, respectively. These amounts represent the estimated net realizable value of the PTCs, which were deferred to a regulatory liability. The Company will continue to assess its calculations and interpretations as new information and guidance becomes available.
The Subsidiary Registrants will work with the state utility commissions on the appropriate regulatory process to pass the net realizable value back to customers over time. See Note 4 for additional information on Duke Energy Carolinas' approval for a stand-alone rider starting January 1, 2025.
In October 2024, $174 million of tax credits were sold for proceeds approximating carrying value, including $150 million of nuclear power PTCs sold by Duke Energy Carolinas.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


The following combined Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. However, none of the registrants make any representation as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the Subsidiary Registrants of Duke Energy other than itself.


DUKE ENERGY


Duke Energy is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and operates in the U.S. primarily through its subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. Duke Energy’s consolidated financial information includes the results of the Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants. 


Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and with Duke Energy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.


Executive Overview

Operational Excellence, Safety and Reliability. The reliable and safe operation of our power generating facilities, electric distribution system and natural gas infrastructure in our communities continues to be foundational to serving our customers, our financial results, and our credibility with stakeholders. In recent months, we have responded to several unprecedented and catastrophic weather events across our service territories.
In August 2024, Hurricane Debby made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 storm, impacting the Duke Energy Florida territory as well as the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress territories in North Carolina and South Carolina and causing approximately 700,000 customer outages. In late September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 storm and subsequently impacted all of Duke Energy's service territories as the storm moved inland, with the most severe damage occurring in Florida and the Carolinas. Approximately 3.5 million customers were impacted by Hurricane Helene across Duke Energy's system, the largest number of companywide outages from a single event on our system ever reported. Then, in October 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida as a Category 3 storm, causing severe damage across our Florida service territory as a result of high winds, rain and flooding and resulting in more than 1 million customer outages.
In such extreme circumstances, our immediate priority is, and always will be, executing the extensive storm preparation and response work to ensure the safe, timely, and efficient restoration of service to impacted customers as quickly as possible. Round-the-clock power restoration efforts continued following the historic damage inflicted by these storms with lineworkers, tree trimmers and removal experts, state department of transportation workers and countless others, working to repair and, in certain areas, completely rebuild, the critical electricity infrastructure that powers and supports the communities we serve. We've also seen the benefits of ongoing grid hardening investments, leveraging self-healing technologies and remote restoration capabilities to automate the rerouting of power, more effectively deploy resources, and reduce the frequency or duration of outages for many of our customers during severe weather events.
We will continue the important work of rebuilding our communities in the weeks and months ahead, including power infrastructure in the hardest-hit areas of our service territories. We also plan to work with our state commissions to appropriately track and recover storm costs under approved regulatory frameworks on a timely basis. We will also remain focused on balancing the bill impacts on our customers from such catastrophic events, including seeking insurance recovery and exploring the potential securitization of related costs in certain jurisdictions, as appropriate. For more information, see "Matters Impacting Future Results," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," and Notes 4 and 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and "Debt and Credit Facilities."
Advancing Our Clean Energy Transition. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to execute on our clean energy transition, remaining focused on reliability and affordability while delivering increasingly clean energy and providing strong, sustainable value for shareholders, customers, communities and employees.
•In May 2024, we entered into memorandums of understanding with several large customers, which propose exploring new and innovative approaches to support carbon-free energy generation and serve future energy needs of large businesses in North Carolina and South Carolina through the use of new tariff structures. The proposed Accelerating Clean Energy (ACE) tariff framework includes new, voluntary pricing structures for large commercial and industrial customers, which enable their direct support of carbon-free energy generation investments including facilitating beneficial customer on-site generation and load flexibility programs. The proposed ACE tariffs would be subject to regulatory approvals and include protections for non-participating customers.
•In January 2024, we filed supplemental modeling and analysis with the NCUC and PSCSC related to our combined systemwide Carolinas Resource Plan filed in August 2023. These updates were necessary due to substantially increased load forecasts resulting from continued economic development successes in the Carolinas occurring since the systemwide integrated resource plan was prepared. In March 2024, we filed for: (i) CPCNs with the NCUC for new natural gas generation facilities at the sites of the current Marshall Steam Station and Roxboro Plant in the Carolinas; and (ii) a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Convenience and Necessity with the PSCSC for a new solar center and associated facilities in Chesterfield and Darlington counties, South Carolina. Our energy transition strategy continues to focus on delivering a path to cleaner energy in a manner that protects grid reliability and affordability, all while meeting the energy demands of the growing and economically vibrant communities that we serve.
•As we continue to strengthen our grid and bring clean energy resources online, our customers are important partners in our clean energy future. In January 2024, we received approval for PowerPairSM, a new incentive-based pilot program for installing home solar generation with battery energy storage in our Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina service territories. Enrollment options for residential customers that participate in the pilot include a one-time incentive of up to $9,000 for the installation of a solar plus battery system. The program was launched in May 2024 and successfully enrolled more than 1,300 customers in its first three months, providing another impactful way for our customers to save energy and money, while exploring new solutions to help manage low carbon grids of the future.

Regulatory Activity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to move our regulatory strategy forward. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information.
•In January 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a South Carolina rate case, the first base rate case filed by Duke Energy Carolinas in the state since 2018 and reflecting the South Carolina retail allocation of significant investments, including approximately $1.5 billion of transmission and distribution assets. In May 2024, we reached a constructive comprehensive settlement with certain parties and in July 2024, the PSCSC issued an order approving the settlement and revising recovery of certain environmental compliance costs. New rates were effective August 1, 2024.
•In April 2024, we filed formal requests for new base rates across several jurisdictions including Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont.
•Duke Energy Florida filed a three-year rate plan that will begin in January 2025, once its current base rate settlement agreement concludes at the end of 2024, and proposed approximately $4.9 billion in incremental investments to reduce outages, expand solar generation, and increase generation unit efficiency. In August 2024, the FPSC approved our constructive comprehensive settlement with certain parties, allowing us to continue making important investments to reduce outages, shorten response times, meet future energy demands, increase clean, solar generation and explore innovative technologies to generate cost savings for our customers.
•Duke Energy Indiana filed a general rate case with the IURC requesting an overall increase in revenues of $492 million. This is the first base rate case filed by Duke Energy Indiana since 2019 and reflects strategic investments to improve grid reliability and security, serve a growing customer base, and meet environmental regulations. These investments, which include approximately 345 miles of new power lines expected to be constructed through 2025, will support the more than 60,000 new customers anticipated since our last base rate case.
•Piedmont filed a general rate case with the NCUC, its first base rate case in North Carolina since 2021, reflecting significant investments to support ongoing service reliability, system growth, and compliance with federal pipeline safety regulations in addition to two energy reliability centers in eastern North Carolina. In September 2024, we reached a constructive comprehensive settlement with certain parties. Revised interim rates were effective November 1, 2024, subject to refund and pending NCUC approval of the settlement and a final order.
•Also, in April 2024, Duke Energy Progress issued $177 million of storm recovery bonds, our first issuance under South Carolina's 2022 securitization legislation, which provided the necessary framework for us to lower the bill impacts on our customers related to critical storm restoration activities.

Matters Impacting Future Results

The matters discussed herein could materially impact the future operating results, financial condition and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants and Business Segments. 

Regulatory Matters


Coal Ash Costs

In April 2024, the EPA issued the 2024 CCR Rule under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule by establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to the 2024 CCR Rule. 
Cost recovery for future expenditures is anticipated and will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations. The majority of spend is expected to occur over the next 10 years. For more information, see "Other Matters" and Notes 4 and 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and "Asset Retirement Obligations."

Fuel Cost Recovery

As a result of rapidly rising commodity costs during 2022, including natural gas, fuel and purchased power prices in excess of amounts included in fuel-related revenues led to an increase in the under collection of fuel costs from customers in jurisdictions including those served by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. These amounts have been deferred in regulatory assets and impacted the cash flows of the registrants, including increased borrowings to temporarily finance related expenditures until recovery. Regulatory filings have been made and approved for recovery of all remaining uncollected 2022 fuel costs. Across all jurisdictions, Duke Energy is currently on pace to recover approximately $1.8 billion of deferred fuel costs in 2024 and we anticipate being in line with our historical average balance of deferred fuel costs by the end of this year.

Storm Cost Recovery

Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, a series of major storm events occurred that resulted in significant damage to utility infrastructure within our service territories and primarily impacted Duke Energy Carolinas', Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Florida's electric utility operations. Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented damage to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the western coast of Florida and certain regions in western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. Appropriate storm cost recovery mechanisms are in place to track and recover incremental costs from such events. Funding restoration activities and, in some cases, the complete rebuild of critical infrastructure, for a series of sequential events of this magnitude has resulted in incremental financing needs until cost recovery occurs and may impact the near-term results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the impacted registrants. For more information related to storm cost estimates, regulatory asset deferrals, and financing activities, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and Notes 4 and 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and "Debt and Credit Facilities."

|  1 | MD&A | MATTERS IMPACTING FUTURE RESULTS |

EPA Regulations of GHG Emissions
In April 2024, the EPA issued a final rule under section 111 of the Clean Air Act (EPA Rule 111) regulating GHG emissions from existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants. Duke Energy is analyzing the potential impacts the rule could have on the Company, which could be material and may influence the timing, nature, and magnitude of future generation investments in our service territories. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to the final rule. For more information, see "Other Matters."

Supply Chain

The Company continues to monitor the ongoing stability of markets for key materials and other developments, including public policy outcomes, that could disrupt or impact the Company's supply chain and, as a result, may impact Duke Energy's execution of its capital plan, future financial results or the achievement of its clean energy goals.

Goodwill

The Duke Energy Registrants performed their annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 31, 2024. As of this date, all of the Duke Energy Registrants' reporting units' estimated fair values materially exceeded the carrying values except for the GU&I reporting unit of Duke Energy Ohio. While no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2024, the potential for deteriorating economic conditions impacting GU&I's future cash flows or equity valuations of peer companies could impact the estimated fair value of GU&I, and goodwill impairment charges could be recorded in the future.

Other

Duke Energy continues to monitor general market conditions, including the potential for interest rate pressures on the Company's cost of capital, which may impact Duke Energy's execution of its capital plan, future financial results, or the achievement of its clean energy goals. 

Results of Operations


Non-GAAP Measures

Management’s Discussion and Analysis includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP in the U.S., as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS, discussed below. Non-GAAP financial measures are numerical measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner. 
Management evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. Adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS represent income from continuing operations available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders in dollar and basic per share amounts, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS are GAAP Reported Earnings (Loss) and GAAP Reported Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share, respectively. 
Special items included in the periods presented below include the following, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:
•Regulatory Matters primarily represents impairment charges related to Duke Energy Carolinas' South Carolina rate case order in 2024 and the Duke Energy North Carolina rate case settlement and Duke Energy Progress' North Carolina rate case order in 2023.
•System Post-Implementation Costs represents the net impact of charges related to nonrecurring customer billing adjustments as a result of implementation of a new customer system.

•Preferred Redemption Costs represents charges related to the redemption of Series B Preferred Stock.

Discontinued operations primarily represents the operating results and impairments recognized related to the sale of Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023 

GAAP reported EPS was $1.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.59 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In addition to the drivers below, GAAP reported EPS increased primarily due to higher impairments on the sale of the Commercial Renewables business in the prior year.
As discussed above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted EPS. Duke Energy’s third quarter 2024 adjusted EPS was $1.62 compared to $1.94 for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in adjusted EPS was primarily due to a higher effective tax rate, storm costs, interest expense, and depreciation expense on a growing asset base, partially offset by growth from rate increases and riders.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023 

GAAP Reported EPS was $4.17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition to the drivers below, GAAP reported EPS increased primarily due to higher impairments on the sale of the Commercial Renewables business in the prior year.
As discussed above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted EPS. Duke Energy’s adjusted EPS was $4.24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in adjusted EPS was primarily due to growth from rate increases and riders, higher sales volumes and favorable weather, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate, interest expense, and depreciation expense on a growing asset base.
The following table reconciles non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EPS, to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023 

EU&I’s results were driven by higher revenues from rate cases across multiple jurisdictions and higher weather-normal retail sales volumes, offset by higher depreciation. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:
•a $152 million increase due to higher pricing from jurisdictional rate cases primarily at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and the 2021 Settlement at Duke Energy Florida;
•a $96 million increase in weather-normal retail sales volumes; and
•a $94 million increase in fuel revenues primarily due to net higher fuel cost recovery in the current year.
Partially offset by:
•a $92 million decrease in storm revenues at Duke Energy Florida;
•a $51 million decrease in rider revenues primarily due to a decrease in the return of EDIT to customers at Duke Energy Carolinas;
•a $32 million decrease in retail sales due to unfavorable weather compared to prior year, including the impacts of decoupling; and
•a $12 million decrease in franchise tax revenue primarily due to decreased revenues over prior year at Duke Energy Florida.
Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:
•a $143 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to higher depreciable base and higher net amortizations driven by the North Carolina rate cases at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and lower amortization of the DOE settlement regulatory liability and higher depreciable base at Duke Energy Florida; and
•a $73 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power due to higher recovery of fuel expense at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, partially offset by lower deferred fuel amortization and lower fuel prices and volumes at Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana.

|  1 | MD&A | SEGMENT RESULTS — ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE |

Partially offset by:
•a $93 million decrease in impairments of assets and other charges primarily related to the prior year rate case impacts at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress;
•a $47 million decrease in property and other taxes due to lower property taxes and lower franchise and gross receipts tax driven by lower revenues at Duke Energy Florida; and
•an $11 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other primarily driven by lower storm amortization at Duke Energy Florida, lower storm and nuclear outage costs at Duke Energy Progress, partially offset by higher storm costs at Duke Energy Carolinas.
Interest Expense. The increase was primarily driven by higher outstanding debt balances and interest rates.
Income Tax Expense. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income and the decrease in the amortization of EDIT. The ETRs for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were 14.1% and 13.2%, respectively. The increase in the ETR is primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of EDIT.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023 

EU&I’s results were driven by higher revenues from rate cases across multiple jurisdictions, improved weather, and higher weather-normal retail sales volumes, partially offset by higher depreciation. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•a $458 million increase due to higher pricing from jurisdictional rate cases primarily at Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Kentucky and the 2021 Settlement at Duke Energy Florida;

•a $259 million increase in retail sales due to improved weather compared to prior year, including the impacts of decoupling;
•a $204 million increase in weather-normal retail sales volumes;
•a $195 million increase in fuel revenues primarily due to net higher fuel cost recovery in the current year;
•a $63 million increase in other revenues for customer programs at Duke Energy Florida; and

•a $50 million increase in rider revenues primarily for the Distribution Capital Investment Rider at Duke Energy Ohio.

Partially offset by:
•a $127 million decrease in storm revenues at Duke Energy Florida.
Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:
•a $330 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to lower amortization of the DOE settlement regulatory liability and higher depreciable base at Duke Energy Florida and higher depreciable base and higher net amortizations driven by the North Carolina rate cases at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress; and
•a $221 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power due to higher recovery of fuel expense at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, partially offset by lower deferred fuel amortization and lower fuel prices and volumes at Duke Energy Indiana, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Ohio.
Partially offset by:
•a $62 million decrease in impairment of assets and other charges primarily related to the prior year North Carolina rate case impacts at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress;
•a $44 million decrease in property and other taxes due to lower property taxes and lower franchise and gross receipts tax driven by lower revenues at Duke Energy Florida; and
•a $43 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other primarily driven by lower storm amortization at Duke Energy Florida and lower outage work at Duke Energy Indiana, partially offset by higher employee-related expenses, higher customer charge-offs and higher storm costs at Duke Energy Carolinas.

Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of the Mint Street parking deck in the prior year at Duke Energy Carolinas.

Interest Expense. The increase was primarily driven by higher outstanding debt balances and interest rates. 
Income Tax Expense. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The ETRs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were 14.8% and 14.4%, respectively.

GU&I’s results were impacted primarily by higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense, partially offset by higher margin growth. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:
•a $5 million increase due to higher base rates, primarily from the Duke Energy Ohio rate case, partially offset by lower rider revenue at Duke Energy Ohio;
•a $4 million increase due to unregulated Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) revenue; 

•a $4 million increase due to the North Carolina IMR; and

•a $4 million increase due to Tennessee ARM revenue.
Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:
•a $13 million increase in cost of natural gas due to higher volumes and higher rates passed through to customers;
•a $12 million increase in depreciation and amortization due to higher depreciable base; and
•a $10 million increase in operations, maintenance and other primarily due to higher employee-related costs, higher operating costs for new RNG projects and higher spend for outside services.
Other Income and Expenses, net. The decrease was primarily due to the revision in the prior year related to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP) ARO closure cost.
Interest Expense. The increase was primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances and interest rates.
Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. The increase in tax benefit was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The ETRs for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were 35.9% and 6.3%, respectively. The increase in the ETR was primarily due to the amortization of EDIT in relation to pretax losses.

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:
•a $31 million increase due to higher base rates, primarily from the Duke Energy Ohio rate case, partially offset by lower rider revenue at Duke Energy Ohio;
•a $21 million increase due to Tennessee ARM revenue;
•a $16 million increase due to the North Carolina IMR;
•a $16 million increase due to unregulated RNG revenue; and
•a $10 million increase due to rate stabilization mechanisms in South Carolina.
Partially offset by:
•a $66 million decrease due to lower natural gas costs passed through to customers and lower rates, partially offset by higher volumes.
Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:
•a $37 million increase in depreciation and amortization due to higher depreciable base, higher depreciation for certain unregulated RNG projects and lower CEP deferrals; 
•a $27 million increase in property and other taxes due to a higher base upon which property taxes are levied; and
•a $27 million increase in operations, maintenance and other primarily due to higher operating costs for new RNG projects, higher employee-related costs, higher IT project costs and higher spend for outside services.
Partially offset by:
•a $54 million decrease in cost of natural gas due to lower natural gas costs passed through to customers and lower rates, partially offset by higher volumes. 
Other Income and Expenses, Net. The decrease was primarily due to the revision in the prior year related to the ACP ARO closure cost and lower revenue in the current year at SustainRNG.
Interest Expense. The increase was primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances and interest rates.
Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The ETRs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were 17.7% and 17.8%, respectively.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:
•a $688 million increase in fuel revenues due to higher fuel rates and volumes;
•a $277 million increase due to higher pricing from the North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases;
•a $129 million increase in retail sales due to improved weather compared to prior year, including the impacts of decoupling;
•a $93 million increase in weather-normal retail sales volumes; and
•a $27 million increase in wholesale power revenues primarily due to higher contractual demand and sales.
Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:
•a $708 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power primarily due to the recovery of fuel expense, and higher volumes, partially offset by lower natural gas prices;
•a $120 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to higher depreciable base and higher net amortizations driven by the North Carolina rate case; and
•a $73 million increase in operation, maintenance and other primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, higher customer charge-offs and higher storm costs.
Partially offset by:
•a $38 million decrease in impairment of assets and other charges primarily related to the prior year North Carolina rate case order and the current year South Carolina rate case order.

Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of the Mint Street parking deck in the prior year.

Interest Expense. The increase was primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances and interest rates.
Income Tax Expense. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of EDIT.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:
•a $227 million increase in fuel revenues due to higher fuel rates and volumes; 
•a $99 million increase in weather-normal retail sales volumes;
•a $96 million increase due to higher pricing from the North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases; 
•a $74 million increase in retail sales due to improved weather compared to prior year, including the impacts of decoupling; and
•a $12 million increase in wholesale revenues, net of fuel, due to higher sales volumes and capacity rates.
Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:
•a $211 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power primarily due to the recovery of fuel expenses and higher volumes, partially offset by lower natural gas prices; 
•a $64 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to higher net amortizations driven by the North Carolina rate case and higher depreciable base; and
•a $26 million increase in operation, maintenance and other primarily due to higher storm costs and higher employee-related expenses, partially offset by lower project costs.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•a $35 million increase in retail revenue riders primarily due to the Distribution Capital Investment Rider, Distribution Storm Rider and Uncollectible Expense Rider, partially offset by a decrease in the Energy Efficiency Rider;

•a $31 million increase due to higher pricing from the Duke Energy Ohio natural gas rate case, net of decreases in the Ohio CEP rider and Accelerated Main Replacement Program Rider;
•a $31 million increase due to higher pricing from the Duke Energy Kentucky electric rate case;
•a $30 million increase in revenues related to higher Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC) rider collections and OVEC sales into PJM Interconnection, LLC;
•a $16 million increase due to improved weather compared to prior year; and
•a $14 million increase in transmission revenue.
Partially offset by:
•a $147 million decrease in fuel-related revenues primarily due to lower full-service retail sales volumes, as well as decreased natural gas costs.
Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:
•a $45 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to a higher base upon which property taxes are levied, partially offset by lower franchise taxes;
•a $31 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily driven by an increase in distribution plant in service and depreciation rates resulting from the Duke Energy Kentucky electric rate case implemented in 2023 and CEP deferrals in 2024; and
•a $20 million increase in operation, maintenance and other primarily due to higher employee-related expenses and storm costs.
Partially offset by:
•an $87 million decrease in fuel expense primarily driven by lower retail prices for natural gas and purchased power and a decrease in purchased power volumes.
Other Income and Expenses, net. The decrease was primarily driven by lower intercompany interest income.
Interest Expense. The increase was primarily driven by higher outstanding debt balances and interest rates.

•a $16 million increase due to North Carolina IMR;
•a $10 million increase due to rate stabilization mechanisms in South Carolina; and
•a $9 million increase due to customer growth.
Partially offset by:
• a $36 million decrease due to lower natural gas costs passed through to customers and lower rates, partially offset by higher volumes.
Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:
• a $19 million increase in operations, maintenance and other primarily due to higher employee-related costs, outside services, and service company costs; and
•a $16 million increase in depreciation and amortization due to higher depreciable base.
Partially offset by:
•a $36 million decrease in cost of natural gas due to lower natural gas costs passed through to customers and lower rates, partially offset by higher volumes.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES


Sources and Uses of Cash

Duke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy’s capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. Additionally, due to its existing tax attributes and projected tax credits to be generated relating to the IRA, Duke Energy does not expect to be a significant federal cash taxpayer until around 2030. Duke Energy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, included a summary and detailed discussion of projected primary sources and uses of cash for 2024 to 2026. 
In 2024, Duke Energy executed several equity forward sales agreements as part of the ATM program. Settlement of the forward sales agreements is expected to occur by December 31, 2024. See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, “Stockholders’ Equity” for further details. Also in 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress began recording nuclear PTC deferred tax assets related to the IRA and began monetizing the PTCs in the transferability markets established by the IRA beginning in October 2024. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress will work with the state utility commissions on the appropriate regulatory process to pass the net realizable value back to customers over time. See Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, “Income Taxes,” for further information.
As of September 30, 2024, Duke Energy had $376 million of cash on hand and $5.4 billion available under its $9 billion Master Credit Facility. Duke Energy expects to have sufficient liquidity in the form of cash on hand, cash from operations and available credit capacity to support its funding needs. 
During the second quarter of 2024, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) maintained the credit ratings and affirmed the ratings outlook for all of the Duke Energy Registrants, including Duke Energy Ohio. Operations in Kentucky are conducted through Duke Energy Ohio's wholly owned subsidiary, Duke Energy Kentucky. Moody's revised Duke Energy Kentucky's ratings outlook to stable, citing the expectation that a credit supportive outcome in the utility's most recent electric rate case will support credit metrics appropriate for its Baa1 rating.

As discussed in Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Variable Interest Entities," Duke Energy terminated and repaid CRC in March 2024 and Duke Energy Florida terminated and repaid DEFR in April 2024. As a result of these repayments, CRC and DEFR have ceased operations and no longer acquire the receivables of Duke Energy’s subsidiaries. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress continue to evaluate financing opportunities and anticipate termination and repayment of the borrowing facilities of DERF and DEPR prior to their scheduled termination dates in January 2025 and April 2025, respectively.
Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, a series of major storm events occurred that resulted in significant damage to utility infrastructure within our service territories and primarily impacted Duke Energy Carolinas', Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Florida's electric utility operations. As discussed in Note 4, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented damage to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the western coast of Florida and certain regions in western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. Funding restoration activities and, in some cases, the complete rebuild of critical infrastructure, for a series of sequential events of this magnitude has resulted in incremental financing needs until cost recovery occurs. See "Matters Impacting Future Results" for further details and Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Debt and Credit Facilities," for information regarding Duke Energy's debt issuances and maturities, available credit facilities including the Master Credit Facility, and term loans executed in response to these major storm events. 

See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Dispositions," for the timing and use of proceeds from the sale of certain Commercial Renewables assets to affiliates of Brookfield.

The variance is primarily driven by:
•a $1,071 million decrease in net working capital and other assets and liabilities amounts, primarily due to the recovery of deferred fuel costs and the timing of accruals and payments; and
•a $565 million increase in net income, after adjustment for non-cash items, primarily due to growth from rate increases and riders, higher sales volumes and favorable weather, partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.

The variance is primarily due to:
•a $1 billion decrease due to the redemption of Series B preferred stock in the current year;
•a $680 million decrease in proceeds from net issuances of long-term debt, primarily due to timing of issuances and redemptions of long-term debt; and
•a $231 million decrease in contributions from noncontrolling interests, primarily due to the prior year sale of the Commercial Renewables business. 
Partially offset by:
•a $424 million increase in net borrowings from notes payable and commercial paper.

OTHER MATTERS


Environmental Regulations

The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note 4, "Regulatory Matters," in Duke Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for more information regarding potential plant retirements and Note 4, "Regulatory Matters," to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information regarding regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.
In April 2024, the EPA issued the 2024 CCR Rule under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule by establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities (Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments). The final rule also imposes a subset of the 2015 CCR Rule’s requirements, including groundwater monitoring, corrective action (where necessary), and in certain cases, closure, and post-closure care requirements, on previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities (CCR Management Units). CCR Management Units may include surface impoundments and landfills that closed prior to the effective date of the 2015 CCR Rule, inactive CCR landfills, and other areas where CCR is managed directly on the land at Duke Energy facilities. Duke Energy, as part of a group of similarly affected electric utilities, filed a petition to challenge the 2024 CCR Rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on August 6, 2024. For more information, see Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations."

|  1 | MD&A | OTHER MATTERS |

In April 2024, the EPA issued a final rule under section 111 of the Clean Air Act (EPA Rule 111) regulating GHG emissions from existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants, referred to as electric generating units (EGUs). EPA Rule 111 requires existing coal-fired power plants expected to operate in 2039 and beyond to reduce GHG emissions by 90% through the use of carbon capture and sequestration starting in 2032, subject to certain modifications for coal plants that retire sooner and co-fire natural gas. EPA Rule 111 also establishes GHG emissions reduction standards for new natural gas-fired EGUs, subject to carve-outs for smaller peaking units that fill gaps that cannot be met with renewables or storage. The EPA did not finalize emission guidelines for GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired stationary combustion turbines and intends to address these in a future rulemaking. Duke Energy is analyzing the potential impacts the rule could have on the Company, which could be material and may influence the timing, nature, and magnitude of future generation investments in our service territories. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to EPA Rule 111 as a member of Electric Generators for a Sensible Transition, a coalition of similarly affected utilities, and as a member of a utility trade group. The litigation is currently pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Cost recovery for future expenditures is anticipated and will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations.

Generation Mix Planning Process

In August 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed their 2023 systemwide Carolinas Resource Plan (the Plan) with the NCUC and PSCSC. The Plan provided a range of generation options, including three core portfolios, reflecting an “all of the above” approach to powering the energy needs of our growing region. In the Plan, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recommended Portfolio 3 as the most prudent path forward to comply with applicable state laws, providing a reliable and orderly energy transition that was proposed as the most reasonable, executable, and lowest-cost plan for the Carolinas. Portfolio 3 proposes a diverse and reliable set of generation and energy storage solutions and shrinks the challenges of growth and the transition from coal by expanding industry-leading energy efficiency and demand response options, laying out a path to reliably exit coal by 2035. Portfolio 3 also makes the most of existing system resources by extending the lives of Duke Energy’s nuclear plants and extending the license and doubling the peak hourly capacity of the Bad Creek pumped-hydro storage facility. Near-term actions consistent with Portfolio 3 were also proposed that will be executed between now and the end of 2026 to advance the orderly energy transition.
In November 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress provided notice to the NCUC and PSCSC of a substantially increased load forecast resulting from increased economic development in the Carolinas occurring since the systemwide Plan was prepared. The companies filed supplemental modeling and analysis with the NCUC and PSCSC in January 2024, demonstrating the need for additional resources beyond the set of resources identified by the companies in their initial plan.
In July 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress reached a broad settlement with the Public Staff of the NCUC, Walmart, and the Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association on the Plan, agreeing it is reasonable to use Portfolio 3 as the reference portfolio for planning purposes. Among other things, the settlement confirms a set of near-term activities, including development and procurement activities for solar, battery storage, onshore wind, and certain natural gas generation assets, as well as certain limited actions exploring initial development activities related to advanced nuclear, offshore wind, and to advance the potential for 1,834 MW of pumped storage hydro at the Bad Creek II facility by 2034. The NCUC conducted evidentiary hearings in July and August 2024 and issued an order accepting the settlement and providing further direction in November 2024. The order continues to emphasize the critical importance of reliability and maintaining affordability, while taking balanced actions to meet forecasted load growth.

The PSCSC held its hearings in September 2024 and in November 2024 voted to approve the Plan and directed Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to work with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff to provide alternative modeling around EPA Rule 111 compliance in a subsequent Carolinas Resource Plan filing.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


The Duke Energy Registrants are, from time to time, parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business. For information regarding legal proceedings, including regulatory and environmental matters, see Note 4, "Regulatory Matters," and Note 5, "Commitments and Contingencies," to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," in Duke Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.


ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, careful consideration should be given to the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Duke Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ financial condition or future results. The information presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in Duke Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

BUSINESS STRATEGY RISKS

Duke Energy’s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy including achieving its carbon emissions reduction goals.
Duke Energy’s results of operations depend, in significant part, on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy successfully. Duke Energy's clean energy transition, which includes achieving net-zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050, modernizing the regulatory construct, transforming the customer experience, and digital transformation, is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control and may make those goals difficult to achieve. 
Federal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of, and increase the costs associated with the use of, fuels or generation technologies, such as natural gas or nuclear power, that enable Duke Energy to reduce its carbon emissions. For example, new EPA rules issued in April 2024 impose stringent GHG emission reduction standards, revised air toxic limits, and wastewater discharge limitations that may impact our carbon-reduction targets, and operational timeline and costs associated with certain new and existing generation. Supportive policies may be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transmission and distribution upgrades needed to accommodate the build out of large volumes of renewables and energy storage. Further, the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the Company to continue to retire existing carbon emitting assets or make investments in new generating capacity. The Company may be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on time. In addition, new technologies that are not yet commercially available or are unproven at utility-scale will likely be needed, including carbon capture and sequestration and supporting infrastructure as well as new resources capable of following electric load over long durations such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if we invest in early stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, Duke Energy’s ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk.
Achieving our carbon reduction goals will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, may challenge our ability to meet customer expectations of reliability and affordability in a carbon constrained environment, particularly as demand increases. Our nuclear fleet is central to our ability to meet these objectives and customer expectations. We are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the 11 reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional 20 years, extending their operating lives to and beyond midcentury. Failure to receive approval from the NRC for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050.
As a consequence, Duke Energy may not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results of its energy transition strategy, which may have an adverse effect on its financial condition.

|  1 | OTHER INFORMATION |


REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL RISKS

The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations requiring significant capital expenditures that can increase the cost of operations, and which may impact or limit business plans, or cause exposure to environmental liabilities.
The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations, including CCRs, air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. For example, the new EPA rules issued in April 2024, among other things, impose stringent GHG emissions limitations on existing coal plants and new natural gas plants and more stringent air toxic limits on existing coal plants, increase limitations on wastewater discharge, and impose groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements on previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities (CCR Management Units) and inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities (Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments). Potential legal challenges to such rules may not be successful, and adherence to these rules may increase the cost of compliance, impact generation resource mix and carbon-reduction targets, and negatively impact customer reliability and affordability due to such rules' imposition of stringent GHG emissions limitations and reliance on carbon capture technologies that are not yet adequately demonstrated at utility-scale. These and other environmental laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the Duke Energy Registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets, as well as reputational damage. The steps the Duke Energy Registrants could be required to take to ensure their facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facilities, which may cause the Duke Energy Registrants to incur losses. Further, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and their contracts with customers. Also, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development projects. Delays in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, failure to obtain and comply with them or changes in environmental laws or regulations to more stringent compliance levels could, and are likely to, result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. The costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have a material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
The EPA has issued or proposed federal regulations, including the new rules issued in April 2024, governing the management of cooling water intake structures, wastewater, CCR management units, air toxics emissions, and CO2 emissions. New state legislation in response to such regulations could impose carbon reduction goals that are more aggressive than the Company's plans. These regulations may require the Duke Energy Registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance costs.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

The reputation and financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants could be negatively impacted due to their obligations to comply with federal and state regulations, laws, and other legal requirements that govern the operations, assessments, storage, closure, remediation, disposal and monitoring relating to CCR, the high costs and new rate impacts associated with implementing these new CCR-related requirements and the strategies and methods necessary to implement these requirements in compliance with these legal obligations.
As a result of electricity produced for decades at coal-fired power plants, the Duke Energy Registrants manage large amounts of CCR that are primarily stored in dry storage within landfills or combined with water in surface impoundments, all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. A CCR-related operational incident could have a material adverse impact on the reputation and results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.
During 2015, EPA regulations were enacted related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the RCRA and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and, new and existing surface impoundments, and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, as well as additional legal requirements that may be imposed in the future, such as the settlement reached with the NCDEQ to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina, and partially excavate the remaining two, and the EPA's January 11, 2022, issuance of a letter interpreting the CCR Rule, including its applicability and closure provisions. Most recently, in April 2024, the EPA issued its final Legacy Surface Impoundment Rule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule to apply to legacy CCR surface impoundments (inactive impoundments at retired facilities) and CCR management units (previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities). These federal and state laws, regulations and other legal requirements may require or result in additional expenditures, including increased operating and maintenance costs, which could affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants will continue to seek full cost recovery for expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commissions, who permit recovery in rates of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated operations, and through other wholesale contracts with terms that contemplate recovery of such costs, although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery. In addition, the timing for and amount of recovery of such costs could have a material adverse impact on Duke Energy's cash flows.
The Duke Energy Registrants have recognized significant AROs related to these CCR-related requirements. Closure activities began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to off-site locations for use as structural fill, to appropriately engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or conversion of the ash for beneficial use. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at the four high-priority North Carolina sites. At other sites, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced. As the closure and CCR management work progresses and final closure plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved at each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts.
