TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.


NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)


1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies

The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity” or the “Company,” which may be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) have been prepared in United States (“U.S.”) dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In management’s opinion, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of interim results. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire fiscal year or any subsequent interim period.The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2023.Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 are to our fiscal years ending September 27, 2024 and ended September 29, 2023, respectively.
Change in Place of Incorporation

In March 2024, our board of directors approved a proposed change in our jurisdiction of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. In connection with the proposed change, we entered into a merger agreement with our wholly-owned subsidiary, TE Connectivity plc, a public limited company incorporated under Irish law. Under the merger agreement, we will be merged with and into TE Connectivity plc, which will be the surviving entity. The merger was approved by shareholders at a special general meeting in June 2024 and is subject to certain closing conditions. We expect to implement the change on or about September 30, 2024. Our shareholders will receive one ordinary share of TE Connectivity plc for each common share of TE Connectivity Ltd. held immediately prior to the merger. Upon completion of the merger, we will be organized under the laws of Ireland. We do not anticipate any material change in our operations or financial results as a result of the merger and change in place of incorporation.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued its final climate disclosure rules, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, which require all registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. The rules require disclosure of, among other things, material climate-related risks, activities to mitigate or adapt to such risks, governance and oversight of such risks, material climate targets and goals, and Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, on a phased-in basis, when those emissions are material. In addition, the final rules require certain disclosures in the notes to the financial statements, including the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions. The rules are effective for us on a phased-in timeline starting in fiscal 2026; however, in April 2024, the SEC issued an order to voluntarily stay its final climate rules pending the completion of judicial review thereof by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. We are currently assessing the impact of the rules on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740)—Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures, to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures through improvements to disclosures related primarily to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments are effective for us in fiscal 2026; however, early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

7



In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280)—Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for our fiscal 2025 Annual Report and subsequent interim periods; however, early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement


In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50)—Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations
, to enhance transparency and introduce new disclosures related to an entity’s use of supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services. The ASU requires us, as a buyer in a supplier finance program, to disclose the key terms of the program, the amount of obligations outstanding, the balance sheet presentation of such amounts, and a rollforward of the obligation activity during the annual period. We adopted this update in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Adoption did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 9 for additional information regarding our supply chain finance program.

Fiscal 2024 Actions

During fiscal 2024, we initiated a restructuring program to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization, primarily in the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. During the nine months ended June 28, 2024, we recorded restructuring charges of $24 million in connection with this program. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during the nine months ended June 28, 2024 by the end of fiscal 2025 and anticipate that additional charges related to actions commenced during the nine months ended June 28, 2024 will be insignificant.
Fiscal 2023 Actions

During fiscal 2023, we initiated a restructuring program associated with cost structure improvements across all segments. In connection with this program, during the nine months ended June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, we recorded net restructuring charges of $7 million and $200 million, respectively. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2023 by the end of fiscal 2025 and to incur additional charges of approximately $10 million related primarily to employee severance and facility exit costs.The following table summarizes expected, incurred, and remaining charges for the fiscal 2023 program by segment as of June 28, 2024:

​

Pre-Fiscal 2023 Actions

During the nine months ended June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, we recorded net restructuring charges of $26 million and $8 million, respectively, related to pre-fiscal 2023 actions. We expect that any additional charges related to restructuring actions commenced prior to fiscal 2023 will be insignificant.

Divestitures

During the nine months ended June 28, 2024, we sold one business for net cash proceeds of $59 million. In connection with the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $10 million in the nine months ended June 28, 2024. Additionally, during the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $60 million when the business was reclassified to held for sale. The business sold was reported in our Transportation Solutions segment.During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we sold three businesses for net cash proceeds of $48 million. In connection with the divestitures, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges and a net pre-tax loss on sales, which totaled to a net charge of $12 million. The businesses sold were both reported in our Industrial Solutions segment. 
Change in Place of Incorporation

During the nine months ended June 28, 2024, we incurred costs of $11 million related to our change in place of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. See Note 1 for additional information regarding the change.
​

3. Acquisitions

During the quarter ended December 29, 2023, we acquired approximately 98.7% of the outstanding shares of Schaffner Holding AG (“Schaffner”), a leader in electromagnetic solutions based in Switzerland, for CHF 505.00 per share in cash for a purchase price of CHF 294 million (equivalent to $339 million), net of cash acquired. As a result of the transaction, we recognized a noncontrolling interest with a fair value of $5 million as of the acquisition date. The acquisition was reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. Our valuation of identifiable intangible assets, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed is currently in process; therefore, the current allocation is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the valuations. The amount of these potential adjustments could be significant. During the quarter ended June 28, 2024, we completed a squeeze-out of the remaining minority shareholders for $5 million and the Schaffner shares were delisted from the SIX Swiss Exchange.We acquired one business for a cash purchase price of $108 million, net of cash acquired, during the nine months ended June 30, 2023. The acquisition was reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.

7. Debt

As of June 28, 2024, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, had $309 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.48%. TEGSA had $330 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.50% at September 29, 2023.During the nine months ended June 28, 2024, we reclassified €550 million of 0.00% euro-denominated senior notes due in February 2025 from long-term
 debt to short-term debt on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.


11



TEGSA entered into a new five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) in April 2024 with aggregate commitments of $1.5 billion, which refinanced and replaced in full TEGSA’s existing $1.5 billion five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (the “Replaced Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility matures in April 2029 and permits, subject to conditions set forth therein, our contemplated merger and change in jurisdiction of incorporation. See Note 1 for additional information regarding the merger and change in our jurisdiction of incorporation. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at June 28, 2024 or the Replaced Credit Facility at September 29, 2023.Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) with respect to revolving loans denominated in U.S. dollars, (a) the term secured overnight financing rate (“Term SOFR”) (as defined in the Credit Facility) or (b) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Bank of America, N.A.’s base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (iii) the Term SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 1%, and (iv) 1%, and (2) with respect to revolving loans determined in an alternative currency, (a) an alternative currency daily rate or (b) an alternative currency term rate, as applicable, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee. Based on the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA, this fee ranges from 5.0 to 12.5 basis points of the lenders’ commitments under the Credit Facility.The fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $4,079 million and $3,974
 million at June 28, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively.

9. Commitments and Contingencies


Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

12




Trade Compliance Matters

We have been investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) and the U.S. State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters, and the resulting investigations are ongoing. We have also been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning aspects of these matters. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies’ investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. Although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved.
Environmental Matters

We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. As of June 28, 2024, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $17 million to $43 million, and we accrued $21 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Guarantees

In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.At June 28, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $185 million, including letters of credit of $22 million associated with our divestiture of the Subsea Communications business. In addition, as of June 28, 2024, we had $24 million of performance guarantees associated with the divestiture. We contractually agreed to continue to honor letters of credit and performance guarantees related to the business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform on these guarantees.
Supply Chain Finance Program

We have an agreement with a financial institution that allows participating suppliers the ability to finance payment obligations. The financial institution has separate arrangements with the suppliers and provides them with the option to request early payment for invoices. We do not determine the terms or conditions of the arrangement between the financial institution and suppliers. Our obligation to suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the suppliers’ decisions to finance amounts under the arrangement and we are not required to post collateral with the financial institution. The outstanding payment obligations under our supply chain finance program, which are included in accounts payable on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $106 million and $109
 million at June 28, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. 






10. Financial Instruments


Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. We expect that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive

income (loss) associated with the cash flow hedge-designated instruments addressing foreign exchange risks will be reclassified into the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations within the next twelve months.
Hedge of Net Investment

We hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany loans and external borrowings denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $1,556 million and $1,709 million at June 28, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. We also use a cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of the contracts under this program was $4,316 million and $3,806 million at June 28, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 1.6% per annum and pay no interest. Upon the maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2028, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currency and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. We are not required to provide collateral for these contracts.These cross-currency swap contracts were recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:​

Commodity Hedges

As part of managing the exposure to certain commodity price fluctuations, we utilize commodity swap contracts. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in prices of commodities used in production. These contracts had an aggregate notional value of $459 million at both June 28, 2024 and September 29, 2023 and were designated as cash flow hedges. These commodity swap contracts were recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:​

​
During the nine months ended June 28, 2024, we contributed $33 million and $20 million to our non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans, respectively. 








12. Income Taxes

We recorded income tax expense of $181 million and $96 million for the quarters ended June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The income tax expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 included a $19 million net income tax benefit related to a divestiture.

We recorded an income tax benefit of $778 million and expense of $283 million for the nine months ended June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended June 28, 2024 included an $874 million net income tax benefit associated with a ten-year tax credit obtained by a Swiss subsidiary and a $262 million income tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of a corporate tax rate increase in Switzerland. In addition, the income tax benefit for the nine months ended June 28, 2024 included a $118 million income tax benefit associated with the tax impacts of a legal entity restructuring with related costs of $4 million recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses for other non-income taxes. The income tax expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 included a $19 million net income tax benefit related to a divestiture.Although it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that, as of June 28, 2024, approximately $30 million of unrecognized income tax benefits, excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months.We are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 28, 2024.

In March 2024, our shareholders approved the TE Connectivity Ltd. 2024 Stock and Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”). The 2024 Plan replaces the TE Connectivity Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive Plan, amended and restated as of December 12, 2023 (the “2007 Plan”), as the source of awards granted. No further awards will be granted under the 2007 Plan and all remaining shares available under the 2007 plan have been cancelled. As of June 28, 2024, we had 20 million shares available for issuance under the 2024 Plan.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading “Forward-Looking Information” and “Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States (“U.S.”) dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).
The following discussion includes organic net sales growth (decline) which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” for additional information regarding this measure.

Change in Place of Incorporation

In March 2024, our board of directors approved a proposed change in our jurisdiction of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. In connection with the proposed change, we entered into a merger agreement with our wholly-owned subsidiary, TE Connectivity plc, a public limited company incorporated under Irish law. Under the merger agreement, we will be merged with and into TE Connectivity plc, which will be the surviving entity. The merger was approved by shareholders at a special general meeting in June 2024 and is subject to certain closing conditions. We expect to implement the change on or about September 30, 2024. Our shareholders will receive one ordinary share of TE Connectivity plc for each common share of TE Connectivity Ltd. held immediately prior to the merger. Upon completion of the merger, we will be organized under the laws of Ireland. We do not anticipate any material change in our operations or financial results as a result of the merger and change in place of incorporation.

Overview

TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity” or the “Company,” which may be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a global industrial technology leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. Our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions enable the distribution of power, signal, and data to advance next-generation transportation, renewable energy, automated factories, data centers, medical technology, and more.

Economic Conditions

Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. The global economy has been impacted in recent years by supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures as well as military conflict in certain parts of the world and the COVID-19 pandemic. We are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve.
In recent years, we have experienced inflationary cost pressures including increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials. However, we have been able to mitigate increased costs and supply chain disruptions through productivity or price increases. Also, we have taken and continue to focus on actions to manage costs, including restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives such as reducing discretionary spending and travel. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. See further discussion in “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

We continue to monitor military conflict in certain parts of the world as well as escalating tensions in surrounding countries and associated sanctions. These did not have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations during fiscal 2023 or the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 
The COVID-19 pandemic had a global impact and resulted in business slowdowns or shutdowns, including systemic disruptions of global supply chains. The pandemic impacted certain aspects of our business, including certain of our operations in China in early fiscal 2023; however, we do not expect the pandemic to have a significant impact on our businesses globally in fiscal 2024.

Outlook

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect our net sales to be approximately $4.0 billion, down slightly from fourth quarter fiscal 2023 levels. Sales declines in the Transportation Solutions segment are expected to be largely offset by sales growth in the Communications Solutions segment. Additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments is as follows:

|  0 | ●  | Transportation Solutions—We expect our net sales in the automotive end market to decrease in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily as a result of a divestiture. For full year fiscal 2024, we expect our sales in the automotive end market to benefit from slight growth in global vehicle production from fiscal 2023 levels. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect our net sales to decrease from the same period of fiscal 2023 in the commercial transportation end market as result of market declines. |

Also, we expect our net sales to decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 from the same period of fiscal 2023 in the industrial equipment end market which continues to be negatively impacted by market weakness and inventory corrections in the supply chain. |

|  0 | ●  | Communications Solutions—In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect our net sales to increase from the same period of fiscal 2023 in both the data and devices and the appliances end markets. We expect our sales in the data and devices end market to benefit from continuing momentum in artificial intelligence applications. |
We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately $1.80 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $56 million and $0.03 per share, respectively, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. Also, this outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.


Acquisition

During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired approximately 98.7% of the outstanding shares of Schaffner Holding AG (“Schaffner”), a leader in electromagnetic solutions based in Switzerland, for CHF 505.00 per share in cash for a purchase price of CHF 294 million (equivalent to $339 million), net of cash acquired. The acquisition was reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed a squeeze-out of the remaining minority shareholders for $5 million and the Schaffner shares were delisted from the SIX Swiss Exchange. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. 

Divestiture

During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we sold one business for net cash proceeds of $59 million. In connection with the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $10 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Additionally, during the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $60 million when the business was reclassified to held for sale. The business sold was reported in our Transportation Solutions segment. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding divestitures.

Net sales decreased $19 million, or 0.5%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in net sales resulted primarily from the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 2.0% due to the 

22



weakening of certain foreign currencies, partially offset by organic net sales growth of 1.7%. Pricing actions positively affected organic net sales by $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, net sales decreased $222 million, or 1.9%, as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 due primarily to organic net sales declines of 0.7% and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 0.7% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies. Pricing actions positively affected organic net sales by $91 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024.

Net Sales by Geographic Region. 
Our business operates in three geographic regions—Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”), Asia–Pacific, and the Americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period.
Approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the first nine months of fiscal 2024.

Gross margin increased $87 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 due primarily to improved manufacturing productivity and the favorable impact of product mix. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, gross margin increased $303 million as compared to the same period of fiscal 2023 primarily as a result of improved manufacturing productivity and the positive impact of pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume.

We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products, and cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. 
Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $41 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 due primarily to the impact of inflation, partially offset by savings attributable to prior restructuring actions.




Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. 
We are committed to continuous productivity improvements, and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.

24



During fiscal 2024, we initiated a restructuring program to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization, primarily in the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. We incurred net restructuring charges of $57 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Annualized cost savings related to the fiscal 2024 actions commenced during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 are expected to be approximately $30 million and are expected to be fully realized by the end of fiscal 2026. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2024, we expect total restructuring charges to be approximately $100 million and total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $200 million.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we incurred costs of $11 million related to our change in place of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the change.

See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Income Taxes. 

See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of income taxes.



The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and participating countries continue to work toward the enactment of a 15% global minimum corporate tax. Member states have begun to enact the rules, with some countries accelerating the impact of these rules by proposing immediate statutory rate increases. Both Switzerland and Ireland have implemented elements of the OECD’s global minimum tax rules, effective as of January 1, 2024. The OECD and participating countries continue to work on defining the underlying rules and administrative procedures. The global minimum tax is a significant structural change to the international taxation framework, which is expected to affect us beginning in fiscal 2025. We are currently monitoring global minimum tax developments and evaluating the impact, which could be material to our results of operations, cash taxes, and worldwide corporate effective tax rate.

Net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment decreased $103 million, or 4.2%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 due primarily to the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 2.1% and the negative impact of 1.8% from a divestiture. Our organic net sales by industry end market were as follows:

|  0 | ●  | Automotive—Our organic net sales increased 3.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as a result of growth of 21.4% in the Asia–Pacific region, partially offset by declines of 7.8% in the EMEA region and 5.2% in the Americas region. Our organic net sales growth in the Asia–Pacific region was attributable primarily to vehicle production growth as well as increased content per vehicle. In the EMEA and Americas regions, our organic net sales declined primarily as a result of declines in vehicle production. |

|  0 | ●  | Automotive—Our organic net sales increased 4.2% in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 with growth of 15.4% in the Asia–Pacific region, partially offset by declines of 3.8% in the Americas region and 3.4% in the EMEA region. Our organic net sales growth in the Asia–Pacific region resulted from vehicle production growth as well as increased content per vehicle. In the Americas and EMEA regions, our organic net sales were impacted by essentially flat vehicle production levels compared to prior year and a shift in platform mix consistent with consumer demand. |

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our access to capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payments of $350 million of 3.45% senior notes due in August 2024 and €550 million of 0.00% euro-denominated senior notes due in February 2025. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions. We believe that we have sufficient financial resources and liquidity which will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital and other cash flow needs.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, net cash provided by operating activities increased $441 million to $2,435 million from $1,994 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase resulted primarily from higher pre-tax income and the impact of changes in working capital levels. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 was $384 million and $354 million, respectively.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Capital expenditures were $467 million and $538 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect fiscal 2024 capital spending levels to be approximately 4% to 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.

During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we acquired one business for a cash purchase price of $339 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired one business for a cash purchase price of $108 million, net of cash acquired, during the first nine months of fiscal 2023. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we received net cash proceeds of $59 million related to the sale of one business. We received net cash proceeds of $48 million related to the sale of three businesses during the first nine months of fiscal 2023. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization


Total debt at June 28, 2024 and September 29, 2023 was $4,202 million and $4,211 million, respectively. See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.

As of June 28, 2024, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, had $309 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.48%. TEGSA had $330 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.50% at September 29, 2023.

TEGSA entered into a new five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) in April 2024 with aggregate commitments of $1.5 billion, which refinanced and replaced in full TEGSA’s existing $1.5 billion five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (the “Replaced Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility matures in April 2029 and permits, subject to conditions set forth therein, our contemplated merger and change in jurisdiction of incorporation. See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the merger and change in our jurisdiction of incorporation. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at June 28, 2024 or the Replaced Credit Facility at September 29, 2023.
The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of June 28, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.
In addition to the Credit Facility, TEGSA is the borrower under our senior notes and commercial paper. TEGSA’s payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.


Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were $564 million and $541 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.
In March 2024, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $2.60 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.65 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1.5 billion in our share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately nine million of our common shares for $1,235 million and approximately five million of our common shares for $621 million under the share repurchase program during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. At June 28, 2024, we had $1.0 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.


Summarized Guarantor Financial Information

As discussed above, our senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are issued by TEGSA and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by TEGSA’s parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. In addition to being the issuer of our debt securities, TEGSA owns, directly or indirectly, all of our operating subsidiaries.

Guarantees

In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2024 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.


At June 28, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $185 million, including letters of credit of $22 million associated with our divestiture of the Subsea Communications business. In addition, as of June 28, 2024, we had $24 million of performance guarantees associated with the divestiture. We contractually agreed to continue to honor letters of credit and performance guarantees related to the business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform on these guarantees.

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 


Trade Compliance Matters

We have been investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) and the U.S. State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters, and the resulting investigations are ongoing. We have also been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning aspects of these matters. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies’ investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. Although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved.




Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses.

33



Our accounting policies for revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and pension plans are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management. For additional information regarding these policies and the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in these policies, refer to “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2023. There were no significant changes to this information during the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 

Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.



Non-GAAP Financial Measure


Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline)

We present organic net sales growth (decline) as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth (decline) represents net sales growth (decline) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth (decline) is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.
Organic net sales growth (decline) provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses this measure together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in “Results of Operations” and “Segment Results” provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth (decline) to net sales growth (decline) calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Organic net sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth (decline) in combination with net sales growth (decline) to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.


Forward-Looking Information

Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include, among others, the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, acquisitions, divestitures, the effects of competition, and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “may,” and “should,” or the negative of these terms or similar expressions.
Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We do not have any intention or obligation to update forward-looking statements after we file this report except as required by law.
