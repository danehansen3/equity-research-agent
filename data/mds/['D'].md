Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies

As permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Companies’ accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain certain condensed financial information and exclude certain footnote disclosures normally included in annual audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
In the Companies’ opinion, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly their financial position at September 30, 2024, their results of operations and changes in equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and their cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Such adjustments are normal and recurring in nature unless otherwise noted.

The Companies make certain estimates and assumptions in preparing their Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

The Companies’ accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances, their accounts, those of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries and non-wholly-owned entities in which they have a controlling financial interest. For certain partnership structures, income is allocated based on the liquidation value of the underlying contractual arrangements.
The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. Information for quarterly periods is affected by seasonal variations in sales, rate changes, electric fuel and other energy-related purchases, purchased gas expenses and other factors.
Certain amounts in the Companies’ 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes have been reclassified to conform to the 2024 presentation for comparative purposes; however, such reclassifications did not affect the Companies’ net income, total assets, liabilities, equity or cash flows.

Amounts disclosed for Dominion Energy are inclusive of Virginia Power, where applicable. There have been no significant changes from Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, with the exception of the items described below.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Virginia Power recorded a $25 million ($18 million after-tax) charge during the third quarter of 2024 within impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income related to the write-off of early-stage development costs associated with a hydroelectric pumped storage facility that it is no longer considering constructing.

Asset Retirement Obligations

In May 2024, the EPA released a final rule to regulate inactive surface impoundments located at retired generating stations that contained CCR and liquids after October 2015, and certain other inactive or previously closed surface impoundments, landfills or other areas that contain accumulations of CCR. Dominion Energy believes that it may have inactive or closed units or areas that could be subject to the final rule at up to 19 different stations, including 12 at Virginia Power. In connection with this rule, in the second quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power recorded an increase to their AROs of $1.1 billion and $420 million, respectively, with a corresponding increase of $536 million and $234 million, respectively, to regulatory assets for amounts recoverable through retail electric rates, including riders, for electric generation stations that have been retired, $505 million and $152 million, respectively, to property, plant and equipment for amounts recoverable for electric generation stations that are currently in service and $34 million to other deferred charges and other assets for amounts associated with non-jurisdictional customers at Virginia Power. In the third quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy recorded an adjustment to decrease the ARO and related property, plant and equipment by $215 million to reflect updated information concerning one facility. The actual AROs related to CCRs may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the obligation.


New Accounting Standards


Climate-Related Disclosures

In March 2024, the SEC issued guidance for climate-related disclosures. The guidance requires disclosure of the financial statement impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions, including amounts capitalized or expensed as well as any associated recoveries. In addition, the guidance requires disclosure of amounts related to renewable energy credits or carbon offsets if utilized as a material component of plans to achieve climate-related targets or goals. This guidance, which is currently subject to a stay issued by the SEC, would be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025. The Companies expect this guidance to only impact their disclosures with no impacts to their results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.



 Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions


Business Review Dispositions


Sale of East Ohio

In September 2023, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement with Enbridge for the East Ohio Transaction, which included the sale of East Ohio and was valued at approximately $6.6 billion, consisting of a purchase price of approximately $4.3 billion in cash and approximately $2.3 billion of assumed indebtedness. The sale closed in March 2024 after all customary closing and regulatory conditions were satisfied, including clearance or approval under or by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, CFIUS and FCC. Dominion Energy utilized the after-tax proceeds, as required, to repay outstanding borrowings under 364-day term loan facilities. See Note 16 for additional information. The purchase price was subject to customary post-closing adjustments, including adjustments for cash, indebtedness, net working capital, capital expenditures and net regulatory assets and liabilities. The transaction was structured as a stock sale for tax purposes. In October 2023, as required under the sale agreement, Dominion Energy filed a notice with the Ohio Commission. The internal reorganization in connection with the East Ohio Transaction was subject to approval by the Utah and Wyoming Commissions. Dominion Energy filed for such approvals in September 2023 which were received in November 2023. The internal reorganization was completed in February 2024.
Dominion Energy retained the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations, including related income tax and other deferred balances, associated with retiree participants in both East Ohio’s union pension and other postretirement benefit plans and retiree participants of the sale entities in the Dominion Energy Pension Plan and the Dominion Energy Retiree Health and Welfare Plan. Dominion Energy recognized a pre-tax loss of $102 million ($113 million after-tax) upon the closing of the transaction, including the write-off of $1.5 billion of goodwill which was not deductible for tax purposes and including the effects of final closing adjustments. In 2023, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $29 million to reflect the recognition of deferred taxes on the outside basis of East Ohio’s stock upon meeting the classification as held for sale. These deferred taxes reversed in the first quarter of 2024 upon closing of the sale and became a component of current income tax expense on the loss on sale disclosed above. See Note 5 for additional information.
At the closing of the East Ohio Transaction, Dominion Energy and Enbridge entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which Dominion Energy will continue to provide certain services to support the ongoing operations of East Ohio for up to approximately two years. Enbridge has also agreed to provide certain services to Dominion Energy.

Sale of PSNC

In September 2023, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement with Enbridge for the PSNC Transaction, which included the sale of PSNC. The sale closed in September 2024 after all customary closing and regulatory conditions were satisfied, including clearance or approval under or by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, CFIUS, FCC and North Carolina Commission. At closing, the transaction was valued at $3.3 billion, consisting of a purchase price of $2.0 billion in cash and $1.3 billion of assumed indebtedness. The purchase price is

subject to customary post-closing adjustments, including adjustments for cash, indebtedness, net working capital, capital expenditures and net regulatory assets and liabilities. The transaction was structured as a stock sale for tax purposes. The internal reorganization in connection with the PSNC Transaction was subject to approval by the North Carolina Commission. Dominion Energy filed for such approval in September 2023 which was received in November 2023. The internal reorganization was completed in December 2023.
Dominion Energy retained the entirety of the assets and obligations, including related income tax and other deferred balances, of the pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans associated with the operations included in the transaction and relating to services provided through closing. Dominion Energy recognized a pre-tax loss of $33 million ($30 million after-tax loss) upon the closing of the transaction, including the write-off of $0.7 billion of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes but excluding the effects of final closing adjustments. In 2023, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $334 million to reflect the deferred taxes on the outside basis of PSNC’s stock upon meeting the classification as held for sale. Dominion Energy recorded an additional charge of $16 million to adjust these deferred taxes to recorded balances as of June 30, 2024. These deferred taxes reversed in the third quarter of 2024 upon closing of the sale and became a component of current income tax expense on the pre-tax loss on sale disclosed above. See Note 5 for additional information.
At the closing of the PSNC Transaction, Dominion Energy and Enbridge entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which Dominion Energy will continue to provide certain services to support the ongoing operations of PSNC for up to approximately two years. Enbridge has also agreed to provide certain services to Dominion Energy.

Sale of Questar Gas and Wexpro

In September 2023, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement with Enbridge for the Questar Gas Transaction, which included the sale of Questar Gas, Wexpro and related affiliates and was valued at approximately $4.3 billion, consisting of a purchase price of approximately $3.0 billion in cash and approximately $1.3 billion of assumed indebtedness. The sale closed in May 2024 after all customary closing and regulatory conditions were satisfied, including clearance or approval under or by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, CFIUS, FCC and Utah and Wyoming Commissions. Dominion Energy utilized the after-tax proceeds, as required, to repay outstanding borrowings under a 364-day term loan facility. See Note 16 for additional information. The purchase price was subject to customary post-closing adjustments, including adjustments for cash, indebtedness, net working capital, capital expenditures and net regulatory assets and liabilities. The transaction was structured as a stock sale for tax purposes. In October 2023, as required under the sale agreement, Dominion Energy filed the notice with the Idaho Commission. The internal reorganization in connection with the Questar Gas Transaction was subject to approval by the Utah and Wyoming Commissions. Dominion Energy filed for such approvals in September 2023 which were received in November 2023. The internal reorganization was completed in February 2024.
Dominion Energy retained the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations, including related income tax and other deferred balances, associated with retiree participants of the sale entities in the Dominion Energy Pension Plan and the Dominion Energy Retiree Health and Welfare Plan. Dominion Energy recognized a pre-tax loss of $30 million ($18 million after-tax gain) upon the closing of the transaction, including the write-off of $0.7 billion of goodwill which was not deductible for tax purposes and including the effects of final closing adjustments. In 2023, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $284 million ($279 million after-tax), including amounts associated with an impairment of goodwill. Based on the recorded balances at March 31, 2024, Dominion Energy recorded an additional charge of $78 million ($78 million after-tax), including amounts associated with an impairment of goodwill, in the first quarter of 2024. Following the internal reorganization noted above and upon closing of the East Ohio Transaction, Dominion Energy recorded a tax benefit of $5 million. In 2023, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $462 million to reflect the deferred taxes on the outside basis of Questar Gas, Wexpro and related affiliates’ stock upon meeting the classification as held for sale. These deferred taxes reversed in the first quarter of 2024 and became a component of current income tax expense. In addition, Dominion Energy recorded an incremental deferred tax benefit of $22 million to reflect the deferred taxes on the outside basis of Questar Gas, Wexpro and related affiliates’ stock in the first quarter of 2024. These deferred taxes reversed in the second quarter of 2024 upon closing of the sale and became a component of current income tax expense on the pre-tax loss on sale disclosed above. See Note 5 for additional information.
At the closing of the Questar Gas Transaction, Dominion Energy and Enbridge entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which Dominion Energy will continue to provide certain services to support the ongoing operations of Questar Gas and Wexpro for up to approximately two years. Enbridge has also agreed to provide certain services to Dominion Energy.

Other Sales

In February 2024, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement with AES to sell Birdseye and the Madison solar project for approximately $17 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, which closed in April 2024. Dominion Energy had previously recognized a charge of $68 million ($51 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2023 to adjust the assets down to their realizable fair value. As a result, the gain on the sale recognized by Dominion Energy in the second quarter of 2024, including the effects of final closing adjustments, was inconsequential.

The IRA created a nuclear production tax credit for electricity produced and sold beginning in 2024. The amount of the credit to be realized, if any, is a function of annual qualified production levels and gross receipts determined for each of the Companies’ nuclear units that cannot be fully determined until the completion of the calendar year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Virginia Power recorded a $53 million tax benefit which represents a prorated portion of the estimated net realizable value of the nuclear production tax credit. The ultimate nuclear production tax credit realized by the Companies could vary significantly based on actual market prices, qualifying production and/or final computational U.S. Treasury guidance.

Dominion Energy’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, includes a net income tax expense of $29 million associated with the remeasurement of consolidated state deferred taxes as a result of the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions and the sale of Dominion Energy's 50% noncontrolling partnership interest in Cove Point. See Notes 3 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a discussion of these transactions.

As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in the Companies’ unrecognized tax benefits or possible changes that could reasonably be expected to occur during the next twelve months. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a discussion of these unrecognized tax benefits.

Discontinued operations
Income tax expense reflected in discontinued operations is $22 million and $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Dominion Energy entered into agreements for the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions in September 2023, each of which was treated as a stock sale for income tax purposes. During 2023 in connection with the pending sales, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $825 million to establish deferred tax liabilities to reflect the excess of financial reporting basis over tax basis in stock of the entities to be sold. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a discussion of these transactions.
Dominion Energy recorded a tax benefit of $52 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, including the reversal of $841 million of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the East Ohio, Questar Gas and PSNC Transactions previously established during 2023 and 2024.

(1)Dilutive securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 consists of certain of the forward sales agreements entered into in the second and third quarters of 2024 (applying the treasury stock method). Dilutive securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 include stock potentially to be issued to satisfy the obligation under a settlement agreement with the SCDOR (applying the if converted method). See Notes 16 and 17 for additional information.

Certain of the forward sales agreements entered into in the second and third quarters of 2024 were potentially dilutive securities but were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as the dilutive stock price threshold was not met.

 Note 8. Fair Value Measurements

The Companies’ fair value measurements are made in accordance with the policies discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 9 in this report for additional information about the Companies’ derivatives and hedge accounting activities.
The Companies enter into certain physical and financial forwards, futures and options, which are considered Level 3 as they have one or more inputs that are not observable and are significant to the valuation. The discounted cash flow method is used to value Level 3 physical and financial forwards and futures contracts. An option model is used to value Level 3 physical options. The discounted cash flow model for forwards and futures calculates mark-to-market valuations based on forward market prices, original transaction prices, volumes, risk-free rate of return and credit spreads. The inputs into the option models are the forward market prices, implied price volatilities, risk-free rate of return, the option expiration dates, the option strike prices, the original sales prices and volumes. For Level 3 fair value measurements, certain forward market prices and implied price volatilities are considered unobservable.

The following table presents the Companies’ quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements at September 30, 2024. The range and weighted average are presented in dollars for market price inputs and percentages for price volatility.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

See Note 11 for information regarding impairment charges recorded by Dominion Energy associated with corporate office buildings and nonregulated renewable natural gas facilities.
In the second quarter of 2023, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $15 million ($11 million after-tax) presented within discontinued operations in its Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust certain nonregulated solar assets down to their estimated fair value, using a market approach, of $22 million. The valuation is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement given that it is based on bids received. As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, these assets were sold in August 2023.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Substantially all of the Companies’ financial instruments are recorded at fair value, with the exception of the instruments described below, which are reported at historical cost. Estimated fair values have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies considered appropriate by management. The carrying amount of cash, restricted cash and equivalents, customer and other receivables, affiliated receivables, short-term debt, affiliated current borrowings, payables to affiliates and accounts payable are representative of fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For the Companies’ financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, the carrying amounts and estimated fair values are as follows:

(1)Fair value is estimated using market prices, where available, and interest rates currently available for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. All fair value measurements are classified as Level 2. The carrying amount of debt issuances with short-term maturities and variable rates refinanced at current market rates is a reasonable estimate of their fair value.
(2)Carrying amount includes current portions included in securities due within one year and amounts which represent the unamortized debt issuance costs and discount or premium. There were no fair value hedges associated with fixed-rate debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Additionally, Dominion Energy carrying amounts include portions classified as current liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2023.
(3)Carrying amount includes current portions included in securities due within one year.

The amounts that will be reclassified from AOCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged transactions (e.g., interest rate payments) in earnings, thereby achieving the realization of prices contemplated by the underlying risk management strategies and will vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in interest rates.

Cove Point


See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of the sale of Dominion Energy’s remaining interest in Cove Point to BHE, which closed in September 2023.

Dominion Energy recorded distributions from Cove Point of $49 million and $227 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
Amounts presented within discontinued operations within Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income related to Cove Point for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $52 million and $218 million of earnings on equity method investees, $69 million and $120 million of interest expense and $7 million and $31 million of income tax expense, respectively.

Atlantic Coast Pipeline


A description of Dominion Energy’s investment in Atlantic Coast Pipeline, including events that led to the cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project in July 2020, is included in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Dominion Energy recorded equity losses related to Atlantic Coast Pipeline of less than $1 million and $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in discontinued operations. Dominion Energy recorded equity losses related to Atlantic Coast Pipeline of $12 million and equity earnings of $16 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in discontinued operations.
At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy has recorded a liability of $10 million and $4 million, respectively, in other current liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets as a result of its share of equity losses exceeding its investment which reflects Dominion Energy’s obligations on behalf of Atlantic Coast Pipeline related to its AROs.
Dominion Energy recorded $70 million of contributions to Atlantic Coast Pipeline during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Dominion Energy expects it could incur additional losses from Atlantic Coast Pipeline as it completes wind-down activities. While Dominion Energy is unable to precisely estimate the amounts to be incurred by Atlantic Coast Pipeline, the portion of such amounts attributable to Dominion Energy is not expected to be material to Dominion Energy’s results of operations, financial position or statement of cash flows.

Dominion Privatization

In February 2024, Dominion Energy received a distribution of $126 million from Dominion Privatization, which was accounted for as a return of an investment.

Sale of Noncontrolling Interest in CVOW Commercial Project

In February 2024, Virginia Power entered into an agreement to sell a 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project to Stonepeak through the formation of OSWP. In October 2024, Virginia Power and Stonepeak closed on the agreement following the receipt of consent by BOEM and satisfaction of other customary closing and regulatory conditions. Consistent with the terms of the agreement, Virginia Power contributed the CVOW Commercial Project and Stonepeak contributed cash to OSWP. The contribution of the CVOW Commercial Project required approvals from the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions, which were received in September 2024. At closing, Virginia Power received $2.6 billion, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, representing 50% of the CVOW Commercial Project construction costs incurred through closing, less an initial withholding of $145 million. If the total project costs of the CVOW Commercial Project are $9.8 billion, excluding financing costs, or less Virginia Power shall receive $100 million of the initial withholding. Such amount is subject to downward adjustment with Virginia Power receiving no withheld amounts if the total costs, excluding financing costs, of the CVOW Commercial Project exceed $11.3 billion.
Virginia Power and Stonepeak will each contribute 50% of the remaining capital necessary to fund construction of the CVOW Commercial Project provided the total project cost, excluding financing costs, is less than $11.3 billion. For capital funding necessary, if any, for total project costs, excluding financing costs, of $11.3 billion through $13.7 billion, Stonepeak will have the option to make additional capital contributions. If Stonepeak elects to make additional capital contributions for project costs, excluding financing costs, in excess of $11.3 billion, if any, Virginia Power shall contribute between 67% and 83% of such capital with Stonepeak contributing the remainder. To the extent that Stonepeak elects not to make such contributions, Virginia Power shall receive an increase in its ownership percentage of OSWP for any contributed capital based on a tiered unit price for membership interests in OSWP as set forth in the agreement. Virginia Power and Stonepeak have the right to provide capital contributions for any total project costs, excluding financing costs, in excess of $13.7 billion.
43




OSWP is considered to be a VIE primarily because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. Virginia Power is considered to be the primary beneficiary and expects to consolidate OSWP with Stonepeak’s interests reflected as noncontrolling interests beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024 as Virginia Power has the power to direct the most significant activities of OSWP, including construction and operation of the CVOW Commercial Project. In the event that OSWP ceases to be a VIE, Virginia Power expects to continue to consolidate OSWP as its ownership interest is expected to be considered a controlling financial interest over the entity through its rights to control operations.

Acquisitions of Nonregulated Solar Projects

Other than the item discussed below, there have been no significant updates to acquisitions of solar projects by the Companies from those discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

In March 2023, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement to acquire the Foxhound solar development project in Virginia (reflected in Contracted Energy) which closed in February 2024, and commenced commercial operations in April 2024. Dominion Energy will claim production tax credits on the energy generated and sold by the project.

Acquisition of Offshore Wind Project

In July 2024, Virginia Power entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 40,000-acre area lease 27 miles off the coast of North Carolina in federal waters and associated project assets in the early stages of development for approximately $160 million. The transaction closed in October 2024 following the receipt of approval from BOEM and other customary regulatory approvals. The CVOW South project, if constructed, is expected to have a generating capacity of 800 MW with ultimate development of the project dependent upon the receipt of approvals from the Virginia Commission and other permitting entities. The project would support Virginia Power’s ability to meet the renewable energy portfolio standards established in the VCEA.

Sales of Corporate Office Buildings

In the second quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $17 million ($12 million after-tax) in impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust a corporate office building down to its estimated fair value, using a market approach, of $23 million. The valuation is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement as it is based on unobservable inputs due to limited comparable market activity. In the third quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy entered into a new agreement to sell the corporate office building for approximately $23 million, which is expected to close by the end of 2024. The corporate office building continues to be reflected in the Corporate and Other segment and presented as held for sale in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
In the first quarter of 2023, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $91 million ($68 million after-tax) in impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust a corporate office building down to its estimated fair value, using a market approach, of $35 million. The valuation is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement as it is based on unobservable inputs due to limited comparable market activity. The corporate office building is reflected in the Corporate and Other segment and presented as held for sale in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023. Dominion Energy completed the sale in July 2024.

Nonregulated Renewable Natural Gas Facilities

Dominion Energy recorded impairment charges of $33 million ($25 million after-tax) and $27 million ($21 million after-tax) in the second and third quarters of 2024, respectively, in impairment of assets and other charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income to write down the long-lived assets of certain nonregulated renewable natural gas facilities under development to their estimated fair values which were each less than $1 million. The fair values were estimated using an income approach. The valuations are considered Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant judgmental and unobservable inputs, including projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risks inherent in future cash flows and market prices.

 Note 13. Regulatory Matters



Regulatory Matters Involving Potential Loss Contingencies


As a result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, the Companies are involved in various regulatory matters. Certain regulatory matters may ultimately result in a loss; however, as such matters are in an initial procedural phase, involve uncertainty as to the outcome of pending reviews or orders, and/or involve significant factual issues that need to be resolved, it is not possible for the Companies to estimate a range of possible loss. For regulatory matters that the Companies cannot estimate, a statement to this effect is made in the description of the matter. Other matters may have progressed sufficiently through the regulatory process such that the Companies are able to estimate a range of possible loss. For regulatory matters that the Companies are able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, an estimated range of possible loss is provided, in excess of the accrued liability (if any) for such matters. Any estimated range is based on currently available information, involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties and may not represent the Companies’ maximum possible loss exposure. The circumstances of such regulatory matters will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. For current matters not specifically reported below, management does not anticipate that the outcome from such matters would have a material effect on the Companies’ financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Other Regulatory Matters


Other than the following matters, there have been no significant developments regarding the pending regulatory matters disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Virginia Regulation - Recent Developments


2023 Biennial Review

In July 2023, Virginia Power filed its base rate case and accompanying schedules in support of the 2023 Biennial Review in accordance with legislation enacted in Virginia in April 2023. Virginia Power’s earnings test analysis, as filed, demonstrated it earned a combined ROE of 9.04% on its generation and distribution services for the test period, within 70 basis points of its authorized ROE of 9.35% established in the 2021 Triennial Review. Virginia Power did not request an increase in base rates for generation and distribution services and proposed that base rates remain at their existing level utilizing an ROE of 9.70% for the prospective test periods and a common equity capitalization to total capitalization ratio of 52.10%. Virginia Power noted that while its prospective test periods would result in a revenue deficiency, it did not request an increase to base rates given that the combination of certain riders with an aggregate annual revenue requirement of at least $350 million into base rates effective July 2023 cannot serve as the basis for an increase in base rates as part of the 2023 Biennial Review.
In November 2023, Virginia Power, the Virginia Commission staff and other parties filed a comprehensive settlement agreement with the Virginia Commission for approval. The comprehensive settlement agreement indicates that Virginia Power demonstrated it earned a combined ROE of 9.05% on its generation and distribution services for the test period, requires previously unrecovered severe weather event costs of $45 million to be recovered through base rates during the 2023-2024 biennial period, with carrying costs, and provides for $15 million in one-time credits to customers by September 2024.
In February 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the comprehensive settlement agreement and issued its order in this matter. In doing so, the Virginia Commission determined that Virginia Power’s earnings for the test period, considered as a whole, were within 70 basis points above or below its authorized ROE of 9.35%. The Virginia Commission also authorized an ROE of 9.70%, as directed by legislation enacted in Virginia in April 2023, for Virginia Power that will be applied to Virginia Power’s riders prospectively and that will also be utilized to measure base rate earnings for the 2025 Biennial Review. In connection with the order, Virginia Power recorded a net benefit of $17 million ($12 million after-tax) in the first quarter of 2024 within impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income for a regulatory asset for previously unrecovered severe weather event costs, which will be amortized by the end of 2024.

Virginia Fuel Expenses

In May 2023, Virginia Power filed its annual fuel factor filing with the Virginia Commission to recover an estimated $2.3 billion in Virginia jurisdictional projected fuel expense for the rate year beginning July 1, 2023 and a projected $1.3 billion under-recovered balance as of June 30, 2023. As discussed in Note 13 to the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Virginia Power proposed two alternatives to recover these under-collected fuel costs, including an option based on an anticipated securitization of up to $1.3 billion under-recovered balance as of June 30, 2023 as permitted under legislation enacted in Virginia in April 2023, with such securitization approved by the Virginia Commission in November 2023 and completed by Virginia Power in February 2024. In March 2024, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Power’s annual fuel factor based on the securitization option, which results in a net decrease in Virginia Power’s fuel revenues for the rate year of approximately $541 million. In addition, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Power’s proposal to alter the order in which revenue from certain customers who elect to pay market-based rates would be allocated between base rates and fuel, which results in a reduction to fuel revenue of $13 million.
In May 2024, Virginia Power filed its annual fuel factor with the Virginia Commission to recover an estimated $2.2 billion in Virginia jurisdictional projected fuel expenses for the rate year beginning July 1, 2024 and to return an estimated $266 million net over-recovered balance through June 30, 2024. Virginia Power’s proposed fuel rate represents a fuel revenue decrease of $636 million when applied to projected kilowatt-hour sales for the rate year beginning July 1, 2024. In May 2024, the Virginia Commission ordered
47




that Virginia Power’s proposed total fuel factor rate be placed into effect on an interim basis for usage on and after July 1, 2024. This matter is pending.

PJM Capacity Expense Deferral

In October 2024, Virginia Power filed a request with the Virginia Commission for approval to defer up to $145 million of capacity expenses expected to be incurred with PJM for 2025 for jurisdictional customers and have such expenses considered as part of the 2027 Biennial Review. This matter is pending.

Renewable Generation Projects

In October 2023, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission for CPCNs to construct or acquire and operate four utility-scale projects totaling approximately 329 MW of solar generation as part of its efforts to meet the renewable generation development targets under the VCEA. The projects, as of October 2023, are expected to cost approximately $850 million in the aggregate, excluding financing costs, and be placed into service between 2024 and 2026. In March 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the petition.
In October 2024, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission for CPCNs to construct or acquire and operate two utility-scale projects totaling approximately 208 MW of solar generation as part of its efforts to meet the renewable generation development targets under the VCEA. The projects, as of October 2024, are expected to cost approximately $605 million in the aggregate, excluding financing costs, and be placed into service between 2026 and 2028. This matter is pending.

Virginia LNG Storage Facility

In June 2024, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission to amend the CPCNs for Brunswick County and Greensville County to construct and operate an LNG production, storage and regasification facility and related transmission facilities adjacent to Greensville County. When complete, the facility will store the liquefied equivalent of approximately 2.0 bcf and would be able to regasify approximately 25% of its storage capacity per day and liquefy from the pipeline less than 1% of its equivalent storage capacity per day. The facility will serve as a backup fuel source for Brunswick County and Greensville County to support operations and improve system reliability. The facility is expected to cost approximately $550 million, excluding financing costs, and be placed into service by the end of 2027. This matter is pending.

Riders

Other than the following matters, there have been no significant developments regarding the significant riders associated with various Virginia Power projects disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

North Carolina Regulation


Virginia Power Base Rate Case

In March 2024, Virginia Power filed its base rate case and schedules with the North Carolina Commission. Virginia Power proposed a non-fuel, base rate increase of $57 million effective November 1, 2024 on an interim basis subject to refund, with any permanent rates ordered by the North Carolina Commission effective February 1, 2025. The base rate increase was proposed to recover the significant investments in generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure for the benefit of North Carolina customers. Virginia Power presented an earned return of 5.01% based upon a fully-adjusted test period, compared to its authorized 9.75% return, and proposed a 10.60% ROE.
50




In October 2024, Virginia Power, the North Carolina public staff and other parties of record filed a settlement agreement with the North Carolina Commission for approval. The settlement agreement provides for a non-fuel, base rate increase of $37 million effective November 1, 2024 on an interim basis subject to refund, with any permanent rates ordered by the North Carolina Commission effective February 1, 2025, and an authorized ROE of 9.95%. In addition, the settlement agreement provides that Virginia Power may file with the North Carolina Commission an application for an annual rider to seek recovery of incurred North Carolina jurisdictional CCR expenses, with the first such rider, if approved by the North Carolina Commission, taking effect February 1, 2025 and covering costs for the period July 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. This matter is pending.

Virginia Power Fuel Filing

In August 2024, Virginia Power submitted its annual filing to the North Carolina Commission to adjust the fuel component of its electric rates. As subsequently updated in October 2024, Virginia Power proposed a total $107 million decrease to the fuel component of its electric rates for the rate year beginning February 1, 2025. In addition, Virginia Power proposed the implementation of a three-month decrement rider effective November 1, 2024 to reduce the over-recovery of the fuel component of its electric rates during the current rate year. These matters are pending.

PSNC Customer Usage Tracker

PSNC utilizes a customer usage tracker, a decoupling mechanism, which allows it to adjust its base rates semi-annually for residential and commercial customers based on average per customer consumption. In March 2024, PSNC submitted a filing with the North Carolina Commission for a $31 million decrease relating to the customer usage tracker. The North Carolina Commission approved the filing in March 2024 with rates effective April 2024.

South Carolina Regulation


Electric Base Rate Case

In March 2024, DESC filed its retail electric base rate case and schedules with the South Carolina Commission. DESC proposed a non-fuel, base rate increase of $295 million, partially offset by a net decrease in storm damage and DSM components of $4 million. If approved, the overall proposed rate increase of $291 million, or 12.59%, would be effective on and after the first billing cycle of September 2024. The base rate increase was proposed to recover the significant investment in assets and operating resources required to serve an expanding customer base, maintain the safety, reliability and efficiency of DESC’s system and meet increasingly stringent reliability, security and environmental requirements for the benefit of South Carolina customers. DESC presented an earned ROE of 4.32% based upon a fully-adjusted test period. The proposed rates would provide for an earned ROE of 10.60% compared to the currently authorized ROE of 9.50%.
In July 2024, DESC, the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and other parties of record filed a comprehensive settlement agreement with the South Carolina Commission for approval. The comprehensive settlement agreement provides for a non-fuel, base rate increase of $219 million prior to the effect of South Carolina Commission-ordered DSM reductions commencing with service rendered on September 1, 2024 and an authorized ROE of 9.94%. In addition, the comprehensive settlement agreement includes that DESC would provide a one-time bill credit in 2024 of approximately $7 million primarily to residential customers. In August 2024, the South Carolina Commission voted to approve the settlement agreement.
In connection with this matter, in the third quarter of 2024 Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $58 million ($44 million after tax) (reflected within the Corporate and Other segment), including $50 million to write down certain materials and supplies inventory presented within impairment of assets and other charges.

Cost of Fuel

DESC’s retail electric rates include a cost of fuel component approved by the South Carolina Commission which may be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the price of fuel purchased by DESC. In February 2024, DESC filed with the South Carolina Commission a proposal to decrease the total fuel cost component of retail electric rates. DESC’s proposed adjustment is designed to recover DESC’s current base fuel costs, including its existing under-collected balance, over the 12-month period beginning with the first billing cycle of May 2024. In addition, DESC proposed an increase to its variable environmental and avoided capacity cost component. The net effect is a proposed annual decrease of $ million. In March 2024, DESC, the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and another party of record filed a settlement agreement with the South Carolina Commission for approval to make certain adjustments to the February 2024 filing that would result in a net annual decrease of $ million. In April 2024, the South Carolina Commission voted to approve the settlement agreement, with rates effective May 2024.
DSM Programs
DESC has approval for a DSM rider through which it recovers expenditures related to its DSM programs. In January 2024, DESC filed an application with the South Carolina Commission seeking approval to recover $47 million of costs and net lost revenues associated with these programs, along with an incentive to invest in such programs. DESC requested that rates be effective with the
51





first billing cycle of May 2024. In April 2024, the South Carolina Commission approved the request, effective with the first billing cycle of May 2024.


Electric - Transmission Project


In March 2024, DESC filed an application with the South Carolina Commission requesting approval of a CPCN to construct and operate the Church Creek - Charleston Transmission Line, comprised of a 7-mile 230 kV transmission line and associated facilities in Charleston County, South Carolina with an estimated total project cost of $40 million. In July 2024, the South Carolina Commission approved the application.


 

Note 14. Leases

Other than the items discussed below, there have been no significant changes regarding the Companies’ leases as described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income include $6 million and $15 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $7 million and $18 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, of rental revenue included in operating revenue. Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income include $3 million and $6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and less than $1 million and $4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, of depreciation expense included in depreciation and amortization related to facilities subject to power purchase agreements under which Dominion Energy is the lessor.
In April 2024, Dominion Energy agreed to pay $47 million in connection with a settlement of an agreement related to the offshore wind installation vessel under development and recorded a charge of $47 million ($35 million after-tax) in the first quarter of 2024 within impairments and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income.

Offshore Wind Vessel Leasing Arrangement

In December 2020, Dominion Energy signed an agreement (most recently amended in August 2024) with a lessor to complete construction of and lease a Jones Act compliant offshore wind installation vessel. This vessel is designed to handle current turbine technologies as well as next generation turbines. The lessor is providing equity and has obtained financing commitments from debt investors, totaling $715 million, to fund the estimated project costs. The project is expected to be completed in early 2025. Dominion Energy has been appointed to act as the construction agent for the lessor, during which time Dominion Energy will request cash draws from the lessor and debt investors to fund all project costs, which totaled $544 million as of September 30, 2024. If the project is terminated under certain events of default, Dominion Energy could be required to pay up to 100% of the then funded amount.
The initial lease term will commence once construction is substantially complete and the vessel is delivered and will mature after five years. At the end of the initial lease term, Dominion Energy can (i) extend the term of the lease for an additional term, subject to the approval of the participants, at current market terms, (ii) purchase the property for an amount equal to the outstanding project costs or, (iii) subject to certain terms and conditions, sell the property on behalf of the lessor to a third party using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the highest cash purchase price for the property. If the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to repay the investors for the outstanding project costs, Dominion Energy may be required to make a payment to the lessor for the difference between the outstanding project costs and sale proceeds. Dominion Energy is not considered the owner during construction for financial accounting purposes and, therefore, will not reflect the construction activity in its consolidated financial statements. Dominion Energy expects to recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding finance lease liability at the commencement of the lease term. Dominion Energy will be considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes, and as a result, will be entitled to tax deductions for depreciation and interest expense.

Note 15. Variable Interest Entities


There have been no significant changes regarding the entities the Companies consider VIEs as described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.


Virginia Power

Virginia Power purchased shared services from DES, an affiliated VIE, of $125 million and $113 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $368 million and $339 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Virginia Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include amounts due to DES of $33 million and $32 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, recorded in payables to affiliates.
As described in Note 18 of the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Virginia Power formed VPFS in October 2023, a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary which is considered to be a VIE, for the sole purpose of securitizing certain of Virginia Power’s under-recovered deferred fuel balance through the issuance of senior secured deferred fuel cost bonds. The Companies’ Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 included balances for VPFS in regulatory
52




assets-current ($119 million), other current assets ($100 million), regulatory assets-noncurrent ($1.1 billion), securities due within one year ($146 million), accrued interest, payroll and taxes ($40 million) and securitization bonds ($1.1 billion).
See Note 11 for discussion of OSWP, which is considered to be a VIE.

Note 16. Significant Financing Transactions


Credit Facilities and Short-term Debt

The Companies use short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In addition, Dominion Energy utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion Energy’s credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties. Other than the items discussed below, there have been no significant changes regarding the Companies’ credit facilities and short-term debt as described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Dominion Energy

Dominion Energy’s short-term financing is supported by its $6.0 billion joint revolving credit facility that provides for a discount in the pricing of certain annual fees and amounts borrowed by Dominion Energy under the facility if Dominion Energy achieves certain annual renewable electric generation and diversity and inclusion objectives.
At September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy’s commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as its capacity available under the credit facility, were as follows:

|    |                                       |               |       |                             |    |       |                              |    |                            |    |       |

(1)This credit facility matures in June 2026, with the potential to be extended by the borrowers to June 2028, and can be used by the borrowers under the credit facility to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to a combined $2.0 billion of letters of credit.
(2)In May 2024, the joint revolving credit facility was amended to remove Questar Gas as a co-borrower. 

DESC’s short-term financing is supported through its access as co-borrower to the joint revolving credit facility discussed above with the Companies. At September 30, 2024, the sub-limit for DESC was $500 million.
In addition to the credit facility mentioned above and Virginia Power’s letter of credit facilities mentioned below, Dominion Energy also had a credit facility which allowed Dominion Energy to issue up to approximately $30 million in letters of credit, which matured in June 2024. At December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy had $25 million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility.
In March 2023, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement with a financial institution which it expects to allow it to issue up to $100 million in letters of credit. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $48 million and $54 million, respectively, in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under this agreement.
In June 2024, the Companies entered into an agreement with a financial institution which the Companies expect to allow the Companies to issue up to a combined $125 million in letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy had no letters of credit issued and outstanding under this agreement.
Dominion Energy has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC for the sale of up to $3.0 billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called Dominion Energy Reliability InvestmentSM as disclosed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include $482 million and $409 million, respectively, with respect to such notes presented within short-term debt. The proceeds are used for general corporate purposes and to repay debt.
In March 2024, Dominion Energy repaid the full $2.5 billion outstanding under its $2.5 billion 364-day term loan facility entered into in January 2023 as amended in January 2024, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the East Ohio Transaction. The debt was scheduled to mature in July 2024. At December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included $2.5 billion with respect to such facility presented within securities due within one year.

In March 2024, Dominion Energy repaid $1.8 billion of its $2.25 billion 364-day term loan facility entered into in October 2023, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the East Ohio Transaction. Subsequently in March 2024, Dominion Energy requested and received a $500 million increase to the amount of the facility and concurrently borrowed $500 million with the proceeds used for general corporate purposes. In May 2024, Dominion Energy repaid the full $976 million outstanding under the facility, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the Questar Gas Transaction. The debt was scheduled to mature in October 2024. At December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included $2.25 billion with respect to such facility presented within securities due within one year.

Virginia Power

Virginia Power’s short-term financing is supported through its access as co-borrower to Dominion Energy’s $6.0 billion joint revolving credit facility. The credit facility can be used for working capital, as support for the combined commercial paper programs of the borrowers under the credit facility and for other general corporate purposes.
At September 30, 2024, Virginia Power’s share of commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding under the joint revolving credit facility with Dominion Energy and DESC was as follows: 

|    |                                       |                  |       |                             |    |     |                              |    |    |

(1)The full amount of the facility is available to Virginia Power, less any amounts outstanding to co-borrowers Dominion Energy and DESC. The sub-limit for Virginia Power is set pursuant to the terms of the facility but can be changed at the option of the borrowers multiple times per year. At September 30, 2024, the sub-limit for Virginia Power was $1.75 billion. If Virginia Power has liquidity needs in excess of its sub-limit, the sub-limit may be changed or such needs may be satisfied through short-term intercompany borrowings from Dominion Energy. This credit facility matures in June 2026, with the potential to be extended by the borrowers to June 2028. The credit facility can be used to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to $2.0 billion (or the sub-limit, whichever is less) of letters of credit.
(2)In May 2024, the joint revolving credit facility was amended to remove Questar Gas as a co-borrower. 

In January 2023, Virginia Power entered into a letter of credit facility which allowed Virginia Power to issue up to $125 million in letters of credit and was scheduled to mature in January 2026. At December 31, 2023, less than $1 million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under this facility with no amounts drawn under the letters of credit. As of March 31, 2024, the credit facility had been terminated.
In March 2023, Virginia Power entered into an agreement with a financial institution, which it expects to allow it to issue up to $300 million in letters of credit. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $ million and $ million, respectively, in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under this agreement.
As noted above, in June 2024, the Companies entered into an agreement with a financial institution which the Companies expect to allow the Companies to issue up to a combined $ million in letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, Virginia Power had $21 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under this agreement.

Long-term Debt


Unless otherwise noted, the proceeds of long-term debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes and/or to repay short-term debt.

In May 2024, Dominion Energy used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 EJSNs discussed below, to repay the outstanding balance of $450 million under the Sustainability Revolving Credit Facility, which is described in Note 18 to the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In June 2024, the facility was amended to extend the maturity date to June 2025. At December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included $450 million with respect to this facility.

In May 2024, Dominion Energy issued $2.0 billion of enhanced junior subordinated notes, consisting of $1.0 billion of 2024 Series A EJSNs and $1.0 billion of 2024 Series B EJSNs that mature in 2055 and 2054, respectively. The 2024 Series A EJSNs will bear interest at 6.875% until February 1, 2030. The interest rate will reset every five years beginning on February 1, 2030, to equal the then-current five-year U.S. Treasury rate plus a spread of 2.386%, provided that the interest rate will not reset below 6.875%. The 2024 Series B EJSNs will bear interest at 7.0% until June 1, 2034. The interest rate will reset every five years beginning on June 1, 2034, to equal the then-current five-year U.S. Treasury rate plus a spread of 2.511%, provided that the interest rate will not reset below 7.0%. Dominion Energy may defer interest payments on the 2024 EJSNs on one or more occasions for up to 10 consecutive
54




years. If interest payments on the 2024 EJSNs are deferred, Dominion Energy may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, declare or pay any dividends or other distributions on, or redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any of its capital stock during the deferral period. Also, during the deferral period, Dominion Energy may not make any payments on or redeem or repurchase any debt securities or make any payments under any guarantee of debt that, in each case, is equal or junior in right of payment to the 2024 EJSNs. Dominion Energy used the proceeds from this issuance for general corporate purposes including the repayment of short-term debt, the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Sustainability Revolving Credit Facility as discussed above and the repurchase of Series B Preferred Stock as discussed below.
In May 2024, Virginia Power remarketed three series of tax-exempt bonds, with an aggregate outstanding principal of $243 million to new investors. All three bonds will bear interest at a coupon of 3.80% until May 2027, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time.
In August 2024, Virginia Power issued $600 million of 5.05% senior notes and $600 million of 5.55% senior notes that mature in 2034 and 2054, respectively. Proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repay amounts outstanding under the intercompany credit facility with Dominion Energy.
In October 2024, Dominion Energy redeemed all $27 million in outstanding principal amount of its 3.80% Peninsula Ports Authority of Virginia Coal Terminal Revenue Refunding Bonds at par plus accrued interest. These bonds, which would have otherwise matured in 2033, are reflected in securities due within one year in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024. Dominion Energy expects to record a charge of less than $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 in connection with this early redemption.
In October 2024, Dominion Energy redeemed all $685 million in outstanding principal amount of its October 2014 hybrids at par plus accrued interest including interest accrued at a floating rate effective October 2024. The notes, which would have otherwise matured in 2054, are reflected in securities due within one year in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024. Dominion Energy expects to record a charge of approximately $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 in connection with this early redemption.
Dominion Energy recognized a charge of $10 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 within interest expense in its Consolidated Statements of Income in connection with the early redemption of Eagle Solar’s secured senior notes in February 2024.

Preferred Stock

Dominion Energy is authorized to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock, which may be designated into separate classes. At December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy had issued and outstanding 1.8 million shares of preferred stock, 0.8 million and 1.0 million of which were designated as the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, respectively. In June 2024, Dominion Energy completed a tender offer repurchasing 0.4 million of the 0.8 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding representing $440 million in aggregate liquidation preference. At September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy had issued and outstanding 1.4 million shares of preferred stock, 0.4 million and 1.0 million of which were designated as the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, respectively.
Dominion Energy recorded dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock of $4 million ($11.625 per share) and $21 million ($33.172 per share) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These amounts exclude a deemed dividend of $9 million representing deferred issuance costs, legal and bank fees and excise tax associated with the shares of Series B Preferred Stock repurchased in June 2024. Dominion Energy recorded dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock of $9 million ($11.625 per share) and $27 million ($34.875 per share) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Dominion Energy recorded dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock of $11 million ($10.875 per share) for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and $33 million ($32.625 per share) for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

There have been no significant changes to Dominion Energy’s Series C Preferred Stock as described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.


Issuance of Common Stock

Dominion Energy recorded, net of fees and commissions, $91 million from the issuance of 2 million shares of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and $102 million from the issuance of 2 million shares of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, through various programs including Dominion Energy Direct® and employee savings plans as described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements to the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In August 2023, Dominion Energy began purchasing its common stock on the open market for these direct stock purchase plans and, in March 2024, began issuing new shares of common stock.




At-the-Market Program

In May 2024, Dominion Energy entered into sales agency agreements to effect sales under a new at-the-market program. Under the sales agency agreements, Dominion Energy may, from time to time, offer and sell shares of its common stock through the sales agents or enter into one or more forward sale agreements with respect to shares of its common stock. Sales by Dominion Energy through the sales agents or by forward sellers pursuant to a forward sale agreement cannot exceed $1.8 billion in the aggregate. Through September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy entered forward sale agreements for approximately 11.4 million shares of its common stock expected to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2024 at a weighted average initial forward price of $53.23 per share. Except in certain circumstances, Dominion Energy can elect physical, cash or net settlement of the forward sale agreements.
In September 2024, Dominion Energy entered forward sale agreements for approximately 3.8 million shares of its common stock expected to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2025 at a weighted average initial forward price of $57.62 per share. Except in certain circumstances, Dominion Energy can elect physical, cash or net settlement of the forward sale agreements.

Repurchase of Common Stock


In November 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Dominion Energy’s common stock, with $0.9 billion available as of September 30, 2024.

Dominion Energy did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, except for shares tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock, which do not count against its stock repurchase authorization.

 

Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies

As a result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, the Companies are involved in legal proceedings before various courts and are periodically subject to governmental examinations (including by regulatory authorities), inquiries and investigations. Certain legal proceedings and governmental examinations involve demands for unspecified amounts of damages, are in an initial procedural phase, involve uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions or involve significant factual issues that need to be resolved, such that it is not possible for the Companies to estimate a range of possible loss. For such matters that the Companies cannot estimate, a statement to this effect is made in the description of the matter. Other matters may have progressed sufficiently through the litigation or investigative processes such that the Companies are able to estimate a range of possible loss. For legal proceedings and governmental examinations that the Companies are able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, an estimated range of possible loss is provided, in excess of the accrued liability (if any) for such matters. The Companies maintain various insurance programs, including general liability insurance coverage which provides coverage for personal injury or wrongful death cases. Any accrued liability is recorded on a gross basis with a receivable also recorded for any probable insurance recoveries. Estimated ranges of loss are inclusive of legal fees and net of any anticipated insurance recoveries. Any estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties. Any estimated range of possible loss may not represent the Companies’ maximum possible loss exposure. The circumstances of such legal proceedings and governmental examinations will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. For current proceedings not specifically reported below, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material effect on the Companies’ financial position, liquidity or results of operations.


Environmental Matters

The Companies are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.


Air

The CAA, as amended, is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation’s air quality. At a minimum, states are required to establish regulatory programs to meet applicable requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of the Companies’ facilities are subject to the CAA’s permitting and other requirements.


Ozone Standards

The EPA published final non-attainment designations for the October 2015 ozone standards in June 2018 with states required to develop plans to address the new standard. Certain states in which the Companies operate have developed plans, and had such plans approved or partially approved by the EPA, which are not expected to have a material impact on the Companies’ results of operations

or cash flows. In March 2023, the EPA issued a final rule specifying an interstate federal implementation plan to comply with certain aspects of planning for the 2015 ozone standards which is applicable in August 2023 for certain states, including Virginia. The interstate federal implementation plan imposes tighter NOX emissions limits during the ozone season and includes provisions for the use of allowances to cover such emissions. Unless and until implementation plans for the 2015 ozone standards are fully developed and approved for all states in which the Companies operate, the Companies are unable to predict whether or to what extent the new rules will ultimately require additional controls. The expenditures required to implement additional controls could have a material impact on the Companies’ results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

ACE Rule
In July 2019, the EPA published the final rule informally referred to as the ACE Rule, as a replacement for the Clean Power Plan. The ACE Rule regulated GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants pursuant to Section 111(d) of the CAA and required states to develop plans by July 2022 establishing unit-specific performance standards for existing coal-fired power plants. In January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE Rule and remanded it to the EPA. This decision would take effect upon issuance of the court’s mandate. In March 2021, the court issued a partial mandate vacating and remanding all parts of the ACE Rule except for the portion of the ACE Rule that repealed the Clean Power Plan. In October 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit’s decision on the ACE Rule. In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit’s decision on the ACE Rule and remanded the case back to the D.C. Circuit. In May 2024, the EPA repealed the ACE Rule as part of a package of final rules addressing CO2 emissions from new and existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units.


Carbon Regulations

In August 2016, the EPA issued a draft rule proposing to reaffirm that a source’s obligation to obtain a PSD or Title V permit for GHGs is triggered only if such permitting requirements are first triggered by non-GHG, or conventional, pollutants that are regulated by the New Source Review program, and exceed a significant emissions rate of 75,000 tons per year of CO2 equivalent emissions. Until the EPA ultimately takes final action on this rulemaking, the Companies cannot predict the impact to their results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

In December 2018, the EPA proposed revised Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources. The proposed rule would amend the previous determination that the best system of emission reduction for newly constructed coal-fired steam generating units is no longer partial carbon capture and storage. Instead, the proposed revised best system of emission reduction for this source category is the most efficient demonstrated steam cycle (e.g., supercritical steam conditions for large units and subcritical steam conditions for small units) in combination with best operating practices. In May 2024, the EPA withdrew the proposed revision to the performance standards for coal-fired steam generating units as part of a package of final rules addressing CO2 emissions from new and existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units.


Water

The CWA, as amended, is a comprehensive program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. The Companies must comply with applicable aspects of the CWA programs at their operating facilities.


Regulation 316(b)

In October 2014, the final regulations under Section 316(b) of the CWA that govern existing facilities and new units at existing facilities that employ a cooling water intake structure and that have flow levels exceeding a minimum threshold became effective. The rule establishes a national standard for impingement based on seven compliance options, but forgoes the creation of a single technology standard for entrainment. Instead, the EPA has delegated entrainment technology decisions to state regulators. State regulators are to make case-by-case entrainment technology determinations after an examination of five mandatory facility-specific factors, including a social cost-benefit test, and six optional facility-specific factors. The rule governs all electric generating stations with water withdrawals above two MGD, with a heightened entrainment analysis for those facilities over 125 MGD. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power currently have 14 and eight facilities, respectively, that are subject to the final regulations. Dominion Energy is also working with the EPA and state regulatory agencies to assess the applicability of Section 316(b) to eight hydroelectric facilities, including three Virginia Power facilities. The Companies anticipate that they may have to install impingement control technologies at certain of these stations that have once-through cooling systems. The Companies are currently evaluating the need or potential for entrainment controls under the final rule as these decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after a thorough review of detailed biological, technological and cost benefit studies. DESC is conducting studies and implementing plans as required by the rule to determine appropriate intake structure modifications at certain facilities to ensure compliance with this rule. While the impacts of this rule could be material to the Companies’ results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory
57




frameworks in South Carolina and Virginia provide rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts for the regulated electric utilities.


Effluent Limitations Guidelines

In September 2015, the EPA released a final rule to revise the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for the Steam Electric Power Generating Category. The final rule established updated standards for wastewater discharges that apply primarily at coal and oil steam generating stations. Affected facilities are required to convert from wet to dry or closed cycle coal ash management, improve existing wastewater treatment systems and/or install new wastewater treatment technologies in order to meet the new discharge limits. In April 2017, the EPA granted two separate petitions for reconsideration of the Effluent Limitations Guidelines final rule and stayed future compliance dates in the rule. Also in April 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted the EPA’s request for a stay of the pending consolidated litigation challenging the rule while the EPA addresses the petitions for reconsideration. In September 2017, the EPA signed a rule to postpone the earliest compliance dates for certain waste streams regulations in the Effluent Limitations Guidelines final rule from November 2018 to November 2020; however, the latest date for compliance for these regulations was December 2023. In October 2020, the EPA released the final rule that extended the latest dates for compliance with individual facilities’ compliance dates that would vary based on circumstances and the determination by state regulators and may range from 2021 to 2028. In May 2024, the EPA released a final rule revising the 2015 and 2020 Effluent Limitations Guidelines, establishing more stringent standards for wastewater discharges for the Steam Electric Power Generating Category, which apply primarily to wastewater discharges at coal and oil steam generating stations. Individual facilities’ compliance dates will vary based on circumstances and the determination by state regulators and may range to 2029, except in certain circumstances when a facility will be retired by 2034. Dominion Energy expects to complete wastewater treatment technology retrofits and modifications at DESC’s Williams generating station, with a similar project at DESC’s Wateree generation station under evaluation, to meet the requirements with the existing regulatory framework in South Carolina providing rate recovery mechanisms for costs of the projects. As discussed in Note 2, the Companies recorded an increase to their AROs in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the expected compliance costs associated with the EPA’s May 2024 final rule concerning CCR. The Companies expect that such AROs would satisfy any AROs that would have otherwise been necessary for compliance with the EPA’s May 2024 Effluent Limitations Guidelines. Dominion Energy is currently unable to estimate what costs, if any, may be required in addition to the project for the Williams generating station, a potential project at the Wateree generating station and the recorded AROs to meet the requirements to operate certain facilities past 2034. However, Dominion Energy expects that while such costs for facility improvements, if required, could be material to the Companies’ financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory frameworks in Virginia and South Carolina provide rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts.


Waste Management and Remediation

The operations of the Companies are subject to a variety of state and federal laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and release of hazardous substances associated with current and/or historical operations. The CERCLA, as amended, and similar state laws, may impose joint, several and strict liability for cleanup on potentially responsible parties who owned, operated or arranged for disposal at facilities affected by a release of hazardous substances. In addition, many states have created programs to incentivize voluntary remediation of sites where historical releases of hazardous substances are identified and property owners or responsible parties decide to initiate cleanups.

From time to time, the Companies may be identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the alleged release of hazardous substances or wastes at a site. Under applicable federal and state laws, the Companies could be responsible for costs associated with the investigation or remediation of impacted sites, or subject to contribution claims by other responsible parties for their costs incurred at such sites. The Companies also may identify, evaluate and remediate other potentially impacted sites under voluntary state programs. Remediation costs may be subject to reimbursement under the Companies’ insurance policies, rate recovery mechanisms, or both. Except as described below, the Companies do not believe these matters will have a material effect on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

Dominion Energy has determined that it is associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, including certain sites associated with Virginia Power. At four sites associated with Dominion Energy, remediation work has been substantially completed under federal or state oversight. Where required, the sites are following state-approved groundwater monitoring programs. Dominion Energy has proposed remediation plans for one site at Virginia Power and expects to commence remediation activities in 2025 depending on receipt of final permits and approvals. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy had $ million and $ million, respectively, of reserves recorded. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Virginia Power had $25 million of reserves recorded. Dominion Energy is associated with three additional sites, including two associated with Virginia Power, which are not under investigation by any state or federal environmental agency nor the subject of any current or proposed plans to perform remediation activities. Due to the uncertainty surrounding such sites, the Companies are unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts.

Other Legal Matters

The Companies are defendants in a number of lawsuits and claims involving unrelated incidents of property damage and personal injury. Due to the uncertainty surrounding these matters, the Companies are unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts; however, they could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.


SCANA Legal Proceedings

The following describes certain legal proceedings involving Dominion Energy, SCANA or DESC relating primarily to events occurring before closing of the SCANA Combination.


Matters Fully Resolved Prior to 2024 Impacting the Consolidated Financial Statements



Governmental Proceedings and Investigations

In June 2018, DESC received a notice of proposed assessment of approximately $410 million, excluding interest, from the SCDOR following its audit of DESC’s sales and use tax returns for the periods September 1, 2008 through December 31, 2017. The proposed assessment, which includes 100% of the NND Project, is based on the SCDOR’s position that DESC’s sales and use tax exemption for the NND Project does not apply because the facility will not become operational. In December 2020, the parties reached an agreement in principle in the amount of $165 million to resolve this matter. In June 2021, the parties executed a settlement agreement which allows DESC to fund the settlement amount through a combination of cash, shares of Dominion Energy common stock or real estate with an initial payment of at least $43 million in shares of Dominion Energy common stock. In August 2021, Dominion Energy issued 0.6 million shares of its common stock to satisfy DESC’s obligation for the initial payment under the settlement agreement. In May 2022, Dominion Energy issued an additional 0.9 million shares of its common stock to partially satisfy DESC’s remaining obligation under the settlement agreement. In June 2022, DESC requested approval from the South Carolina Commission to transfer certain real estate with a total settlement value of $51 million to satisfy its remaining obligation under the settlement agreement. In July 2022, the South Carolina Commission voted to approve the request and issued its final order in August 2022. In September 2022, DESC transferred certain non-utility property with a fair value of $28 million to the SCDOR under the settlement agreement. In December 2022, DESC transferred additional utility property with a fair value of $3 million to the SCDOR. In October 2022, DESC filed for approval to transfer the remaining real estate with FERC which was received in November 2022. In March 2023, DESC transferred utility property with a fair value of $10 million to the SCDOR resulting in a gain of $9 million ($7 million after-tax), recorded in losses (gains) on sales of assets in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In June 2023, DESC transferred the remaining utility property with a fair value of $11 million to the SCDOR resulting in a gain of $11 million ($8 million after-tax), recorded in losses (gains) on sales of assets in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In July 2023, DESC made a less than $1 million cash payment to the SCDOR to fully satisfy its remaining obligation, including applicable interest, under the settlement agreement.


Nuclear Operations


Nuclear Insurance

Other than the items discussed below, there have been no significant changes regarding the Companies’ nuclear insurance as described in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
During the first quarter of 2024, the total liability protection per nuclear incident available to all participants in the Secondary Financial Protection Program increased from $16.2 billion to $16.3 billion. This increase does not impact Dominion Energy’s responsibility per active unit under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988. Additionally, the Companies increased the amount of coverage purchased from commercial insurance pools for Millstone, Summer, Surry and North Anna from $450 million to $500 million with the remainder provided through the mandatory industry retrospective rating plan.


Spent Nuclear Fuel


As discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Companies entered into contracts with the DOE for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel under provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.

Guarantees, Surety Bonds and Letters of Credit

Dominion Energy enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries, primarily to facilitate their commercial transactions with third parties. If any of these subsidiaries fail to perform or pay under the contracts and the counterparties seek performance or payment, Dominion Energy would be obligated to satisfy such obligation. To the extent that a liability subject to a guarantee has been incurred by one of Dominion Energy’s consolidated subsidiaries, that liability is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Dominion Energy is not required to recognize liabilities for guarantees issued on behalf of its subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that it will have to perform under the guarantees. Terms of the guarantees typically end once obligations have been paid. Dominion Energy currently believes it is unlikely that it would be required to perform or otherwise incur any losses associated with guarantees of its subsidiaries’ obligations.

At September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy had issued the following subsidiary guarantees:
 
|    |                           |                 |       |
|---:|:--------------------------|:----------------|:------|

|  7 | Total(5)(6)               | $               | 4,041 |

(1)Guarantees related to commodity commitments of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transaction related commodities and services. 
(2)Guarantees primarily related to certain DGI subsidiaries regarding all aspects of running a nuclear facility. 
(3)Includes guarantees to facilitate the development of solar projects.
(4)Guarantees related to other miscellaneous contractual obligations such as leases, environmental obligations, construction projects and insurance programs. Due to the uncertainty of workers’ compensation claims, the parental guarantee has no stated limit. 

(5)Excludes Dominion Energy’s guarantee of an offshore wind installation vessel discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

(6)In July 2016, Dominion Energy signed an agreement (subsequently amended most recently in December 2023) with a lessor to construct and lease a new corporate office property in Richmond, Virginia and commenced the five-year lease term in August 2019, with certain options at the end of the initial lease term as discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In July 2024, the agreement was amended to reflect Dominion Energy’s election to extend the lease term through July 2029. At the end of the lease term, Dominion Energy can (i) extend the term of the lease for at least one year, subject to the approval of the participants, at current market terms, (ii) purchase the property for an amount equal to the project costs or, (iii) subject to certain terms and conditions, sell the property on behalf of the lessor to a third party using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the highest cash purchase price for the property. If the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to repay the investors for the project costs, Dominion Energy may be required to make a payment to the lessor equal to the recorded lease balance.


In addition, Dominion Energy had issued an additional $20 million of guarantees at September 30, 2024, primarily to support third parties. No amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded.

Dominion Energy also had issued four guarantees as of September 30, 2024 related to Cove Point, previously an equity method investment, in support of terminal services, transportation and construction. Two of the Cove Point guarantees have a cumulative maximum exposure of $1.9 billion while the other two guarantees have no maximum limit. No amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded.

Additionally, at September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy had purchased $319 million of surety bonds, including $250 million at Virginia Power, and authorized the issuance of letters of credit by financial institutions of $21 million to facilitate commercial transactions by its subsidiaries with third parties. Under the terms of surety bonds, the Companies are obligated to indemnify the respective surety bond company for any amounts paid.


 Note 18. Credit Risk


The Companies’ accounting policies for credit risk are discussed in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

At September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy’s credit exposure totaled $138 million, primarily related to price risk management activities. Of this amount, investment grade counterparties, including those internally rated, represented 74%. No single counterparty, whether investment grade or non-investment grade, exceeded $28 million of exposure. At September 30, 2024, Virginia Power’s exposure related to wholesale customers totaled $82 million. Of this amount, investment grade counterparties, including those
60




internally rated, represented 58%. No single counterparty, whether investment grade or non-investment grade, exceeded $10 million of exposure.

Credit-Related Contingent Provisions

Certain of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s derivative instruments contain credit-related contingent provisions. These provisions require Dominion Energy and Virginia Power to provide collateral upon the occurrence of specific events, primarily a credit rating downgrade. If the credit-related contingent features underlying these instruments that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash were fully triggered, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power would have been required to post additional collateral to its counterparties of $19 million and $13 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and $28 million and $14 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The collateral that would be required to be posted includes the impacts of any offsetting asset positions and any amounts already posted for derivatives, non-derivative contracts and derivatives elected under the normal purchases and normal sales exception, per contractual terms. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had no posted collateral at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 related to derivatives with credit-related contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash. In addition, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had both posted letters of credit as collateral with counterparties covering less than $1 million of fair value of derivative instruments in a liability position at December 31, 2023. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit related contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash for Dominion Energy and Virginia Power was $19 million and $13 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and $28 million and $14 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, which does not include the impact of any offsetting asset positions.
See Note 9 for additional information about derivative instruments.


 Note 19. Related-Party Transactions

Dominion Energy’s transactions with equity method investments are described in Note 10. Virginia Power engages in related-party transactions primarily with other Dominion Energy subsidiaries (affiliates). Virginia Power’s receivable and payable balances with affiliates are settled based on contractual terms or on a monthly basis, depending on the nature of the underlying transactions. Virginia Power is included in Dominion Energy’s consolidated federal income tax return and, where applicable, combined income tax returns for Dominion Energy are filed in various states. A discussion of Virginia Power’s significant related-party transactions follows.
Virginia Power transacts with affiliates for certain quantities of natural gas and other commodities in the ordinary course of business. Virginia Power also enters into certain commodity derivative contracts with affiliates. Virginia Power uses these contracts, which are principally comprised of forward commodity purchases, to manage commodity price risks associated with purchases of natural gas. At September 30, 2024, Virginia Power’s derivative assets and liabilities with affiliates were $11 million and $43 million, respectively. At December 31, 2023, Virginia Power’s derivative assets and liabilities with affiliates were $1 million and $79 million, respectively. See Note 9 for additional information.

Virginia Power participates in certain Dominion Energy benefit plans described in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, amounts due to Dominion Energy associated with the Dominion Energy Pension Plan and included in other deferred credits and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $493 million and $456 million, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Virginia Power’s amounts due from Dominion Energy associated with the Dominion Energy Retiree Health and Welfare Plan and included in other deferred charges and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $640 million and $584 million, respectively.

DES and other affiliates provide accounting, legal, finance and certain administrative and technical services and licenses to Virginia Power. In addition, Virginia Power provides certain services to affiliates, including charges for facilities and equipment usage.
The financial statements for all years presented include costs for certain general, administrative and corporate expenses assigned by DES to Virginia Power on the basis of direct and allocated methods in accordance with Virginia Power’s services agreements with DES. Where costs incurred cannot be determined by specific identification, the costs are allocated based on the proportional level of effort devoted by DES resources that is attributable to the entity, determined by reference to number of employees, salaries and wages and other similar measures for the relevant DES service. Management believes the assumptions and methodologies underlying the allocation of general corporate overhead expenses are reasonable.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Remeasurements

In the first quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy remeasured its pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a result of the close of the East Ohio Transaction. The remeasurement and transfer to Enbridge of pension plan assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in the pension benefit obligation of $419 million, inclusive of $195 million transferred upon closing, and a decrease in the fair value of

the pension plan assets of $555 million, inclusive of $531 million transferred upon closing. In addition, the remeasurement and transfer to Enbridge of other postretirement benefit plan assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $38 million, inclusive of $22 million transferred upon closing, and a decrease in the fair value of the other postretirement benefit plan assets of $19 million, inclusive of $36 million transferred upon closing. The impact of the remeasurement and transfer of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and liabilities on net periodic benefit cost (credit) was recognized prospectively from the remeasurement date. The remeasurement is expected to decrease the net periodic pension benefit credit by approximately $11 million and increase the net periodic other postretirement benefit credit by approximately $1 million for the year ending December 31, 2024, excluding the impact of a one-time plan amendment. The discount rate used for the remeasurement was 5.62% for the pension plans and 5.61%-5.62% for the other postretirement benefit plans. The net actuarial loss (gain) and prior service cost (credit) related to the transferred pension and other postretirement plan assets and liabilities included in the East Ohio Transaction loss on sale was $147 million for pension and $(9) million for other postretirement benefits.
In the second quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy remeasured its pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a result of the close of the Questar Gas Transaction. The remeasurement and transfer to Enbridge of pension plan assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in the pension benefit obligation of $251 million, inclusive of $136 million transferred upon closing, and a decrease in the fair value of the pension plan assets of $248 million, inclusive of $138 million transferred upon closing. In addition, the remeasurement and transfer to Enbridge of other postretirement benefit plan assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $14 million, inclusive of $6 million transferred upon closing, and an increase in the fair value of the other postretirement benefit plan assets of $24 million, inclusive of $5 million transferred upon closing. The impact of the remeasurement and transfer of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and liabilities on net periodic benefit cost (credit) was recognized prospectively from the remeasurement date. The remeasurement is expected to increase the net periodic pension benefit credit by approximately $8 million and increase the net periodic other postretirement benefit credit by $3 million for the year ending December 31, 2024. The discount rate used for the remeasurement was 5.75% for the pension plan and 5.74% for the other postretirement benefit plan. The net actuarial loss and prior service cost (credit) related to the transferred pension and other postretirement plan assets and liabilities included in the Questar Gas Transaction loss on sale was $49 million for pension and $1 million for other postretirement benefits.
All other assumptions used for the remeasurements were consistent with the measurement as of December 31, 2023.

 Overview


Third Quarter 2024 vs. 2023

 Net income attributable to Dominion Energy increased $797 million, primarily due to the absence of a charge to reflect the recognition of deferred taxes on the outside basis of stock associated with East Ohio, PSNC, Questar Gas and Wexpro meeting the classification as held for sale, higher rider equity returns reflecting increased capital investments at Virginia Power and an increase in net investment earnings on nuclear decommissioning trust funds, partially offset by the absence of a gain on the sale of Dominion Energy’s remaining noncontrolling interest in Cove Point.
 69




Year-To-Date 2024 vs. 2023
 Net income attributable to Dominion Energy increased 28%, primarily due to the absence of a charge to reflect the recognition of deferred taxes on the outside basis of stock associated with East Ohio, PSNC, Questar Gas and Wexpro meeting the classification as held for sale, an increase in net investment earnings on nuclear decommissioning trust funds, the absence of depreciation expense associated with the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions upon meeting the classification as held for sale, higher rider equity returns reflecting increased capital investments at Virginia Power, an increase in sales to electric utility customers attributable to weather and the absence of amortization associated with the 2021 Triennial Review. These increases were partially offset by the closing of the East Ohio Transaction, the absence of a gain and equity method earnings from the sale of Dominion Energy’s remaining noncontrolling interest in Cove Point, increased unrealized losses on economic hedging activities and the impact of 2023 Virginia legislation.

An analysis of Dominion Energy’s results of operations follows:
 
Third Quarter 2024 vs. 2023

 Operating revenue increased 3%, primarily reflecting:
 •A $137 million increase to recover the costs and an authorized return, as applicable, associated with Virginia Power non-fuel riders;
 •A $101 million increase associated with market prices affecting Millstone, including economic hedging impacts of realized and unrealized gains on freestanding derivatives ($91 million);
 •A $51 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth;
 •A $17 million increase in non-fuel base rates associated with the settlement of the electric base rate case in South Carolina;
 •A $14 million net increase in transition service agreements primarily associated with the East Ohio and Questar Gas Transactions; and
 •A $10 million net increase from electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates, including settlements of economic hedges at Virginia Power prior to March 2024.
 These increases were partially offset by:
 •A $135 million net decrease in fuel-related revenue as a result of a decrease in commodity costs associated with sales to electric utility retail customers, including revenue for the deferred fuel securitization and electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates and related settlements of economic hedges at Virginia Power effective March 2024;
 •A $34 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with economic and other usage factors;


•A $22 million decrease due to one-time credits to customers associated with the 2023 Biennial Review and the electric base rate case in South Carolina;
 •A $21 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers, primarily due to a decrease in cooling degree days during the cooling season; and
 •A $16 million decrease from unplanned outages at Millstone.
 Electric fuel and other energy-related purchases decreased 13%, primarily due to lower commodity costs for electric utilities ($159 million), partially offset by an increase in the use of purchased renewable energy credits at Virginia Power ($19 million), which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.
 
Other operations and maintenance increased 7%, primarily reflecting:
 •A $35 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits;
 •A $24 million increase in certain Virginia Power expenditures which are primarily recovered through state- and FERC-regulated rates and do not impact net income;
 •A $14 million increase in materials and supplies expense; and
 •A $13 million increase in outside services.
 These increases were partially offset by:
 •A $20 million decrease in bad debt expense; and
 •A $19 million decrease in storm damage and restoration costs in Virginia Power’s service territory.
 
Depreciation and amortization decreased 18%, primarily due to the absence of amortization of a regulatory asset established in the settlement of the 2021 Triennial Review ($61 million) and the absence of RGGI-related amortization ($36 million) and a decrease in amortization associated with Virginia Power non-fuel riders ($13 million), both of which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.
 
Other taxes increased 14%, primarily due to higher property taxes.
 
Impairment of assets and other charges increased $121 million, primarily due to a $55 million charge in connection with the electric base rate case in South Carolina primarily to write down certain materials and supplies inventory, a charge for the impairment of certain nonregulated renewable natural gas facilities ($27 million), a charge related to the write-off of certain early-stage development costs at Virginia Power ($30 million) and the absence of a benefit related to dismantling costs and other activities associated with certain retired electric generation facilities at Virginia Power ($13 million).
 Other income increased $279 million, primarily due to net investment gains in 2024 compared to net investment losses in 2023 on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($269 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($19 million).
 
Interest and related charges increased $211 million, primarily reflecting:
 •Lower unrealized gains in 2024 compared to 2023 associated with freestanding derivatives ($219 million);
 •Net issuances of long-term debt ($80 million);
 •Increased interest expense associated with rider deferrals ($15 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income; and 
 •Charges incurred due to early debt repayments associated with the business review completed in March 2024 ($13 million).
 
These increases were partially offset by:
 •A decrease in borrowings under the 364-day term loan facilities ($54 million); and 
 •Variable rate debt repaid from business review proceeds ($35 million).
 
Income tax expense decreased 6%, primarily due to a nuclear production tax credit ($36 million), the absence of an increase in consolidated state deferred income taxes associated with the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions and the sale of Dominion

Energy’s 50% noncontrolling interest in Cove Point ($29 million) and a benefit associated with the effective settlement of an uncertain tax position ($14 million), partially offset by higher pre-tax income ($66 million).
 
Net income from discontinued operations including noncontrolling interests increased 98%, primarily due to the absence of charges reflecting the recognition of deferred taxes on the outside basis of stock associated with East Ohio, PSNC, Questar Gas and Wexpro meeting the classification as held for sale ($939 million), the absence of depreciation expense associated with the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions upon meeting the classification as held for sale ($54 million) and the absence of interest expense on variable rate debt secured by Dominion Energy’s interest in Cove Point ($19 million), partially offset by the absence of a gain on the sale of Dominion Energy’s remaining noncontrolling interest in Cove Point ($348 million), the absence of earnings from operations following the closing of the East Ohio Transaction ($87 million) and Questar Gas Transaction ($32 million), the absence of equity method earnings from the sale of Dominion Energy’s noncontrolling interest in Cove Point ($39 million) and a loss on the closing of the PSNC Transaction ($30 million).
 Year-To-Date 2024 vs. 2023
 Operating revenue increased 2%, primarily reflecting:
 •A $557 million increase to recover the costs and an authorized return, as applicable, associated with Virginia Power non-fuel riders;
 •A $150 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers, primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days during the cooling season ($107 million) and an increase in heating degree days during the heating season ($43 million);
 •A $115 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth;
 •An $85 million increase from fewer outages at Millstone, including the relative effect of the absence of a planned outage ($73 million) and fewer unplanned outages ($12 million);
 •A $62 million net increase from electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates, including settlements of economic hedges at Virginia Power prior to March 2024;
 •An $18 million net increase in transition service agreements primarily associated with the East Ohio and Questar Gas Transactions; and
 •A $17 million increase in non-fuel base rates associated with the settlement of the electric base rate case in South Carolina;
 These increases were partially offset by:
 •A $352 million net decrease associated with market prices affecting Millstone, including economic hedging impacts of net realized and unrealized losses on freestanding derivatives ($323 million);
 •A $196 million net decrease in fuel-related revenue as a result of a decrease in commodity costs associated with sales to electric utility retail customers, including revenue for the deferred fuel securitization and electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates and related settlements of economic hedges at Virginia Power effective March 2024;
 •A $184 million decrease from the combination of certain riders into base rates at Virginia Power as a result of 2023 Virginia legislation;
 •A $86 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with economic and other usage factors; and
 •A $22 million decrease due to one-time credits to customers associated with the 2023 Biennial Review and the electric base rate case in South Carolina.
 
Electric fuel and other energy-related purchases decreased 7%, primarily due to lower commodity costs for electric utilities, which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.
 
Other operations and maintenance increased 10%, primarily reflecting:
•A $55 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits;
 •A $53 million increase in certain Virginia Power expenditures which are primarily recovered through state- and FERC-regulated rates and do not impact net income;
 •A $43 million increase from the combination of certain riders into base rates as a result of 2023 Virginia legislation;
 •A $32 million increase in costs associated with the business review completed in March 2024;


•A $28 million increase in materials and supplies expense; and
 •A $26 million increase in outside services.
 These increases were partially offset by:
 •A $38 million net decrease in outage costs due to lower outage costs at Millstone ($51 million) partially offset by higher outage costs at Virginia Power ($13 million).
 
Depreciation and amortization decreased 6%, primarily reflecting:
 •The absence of $183 million in amortization of a regulatory asset established in the settlement of the 2021 Triennial Review; 
 •A $67 million decrease in amortization associated with Virginia Power non-fuel riders, which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income;
 •A $29 million decrease due to revised estimated useful lives at Millstone; and
 •A $13 million decrease due to revised depreciation rates for Bath County.
 These decreases were partially offset by:
•A $143 million increase in RGGI-related amortization, which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income; and
 •A $37 million increase due to various projects being placed into service.
 
Impairment of assets and other charges increased 61%, primarily reflecting:
 •Charges for the impairment of certain nonregulated renewable natural gas facilities ($60 million);
 •A $55 million charge in connection with the electric base rate case in South Carolina primarily to write down certain materials and supplies inventory;
 •A charge in connection with a settlement of an agreement ($47 million); and 
 •A charge related to the write-off of certain early-stage development costs at Virginia Power ($30 million).
 These increases were partially offset by:
•A decrease in impairments of corporate office buildings ($74 million); and 
 •The absence of a charge for the write-off of certain previously deferred amounts related to the cessation of certain riders effective July 2023 ($36 million).
 Gains on sales of assets decreased 91%, primarily due to the absence of a gain on the transfer of certain utility property in South Carolina.
 Other income increased 58%, primarily due to an increase in net investment gains on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($343 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($30 million).
 
Interest and related charges increased 36%, primarily reflecting:
 •Lower unrealized gains in 2024 compared to 2023 associated with freestanding derivatives ($250 million);
 •Net issuances of long-term debt ($163 million);
 •Charges incurred due to early debt repayments associated with the business review completed in March 2024 ($25 million);
 •Increased interest expense associated with rider deferrals ($23 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income; and
 •Higher interest rates on commercial paper and long-term debt ($13 million).
 These increases were partially offset by:
 •A decrease in borrowings under the 364-day term loan facilities ($45 million); and 
 •Variable rate debt repaid from business review proceeds ($21 million).



Income tax expense decreased 12%, primarily due to a nuclear production tax credit ($53 million) and the absence of an increase in consolidated state deferred income taxes associated with the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions and the sale of Dominion Energy’s 50% noncontrolling interest in Cove Point ($29 million), partially offset by higher pre-tax income ($28 million).
 
Net income from discontinued operations including noncontrolling interests increased $274 million, primarily due to the absence of charges reflecting the recognition of deferred taxes on the outside basis of stock associated with East Ohio, PSNC, Questar Gas and Wexpro meeting the classification as held for sale ($939 million), the absence of depreciation expense associated with the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions upon meeting the classification as held for sale ($211 million), the absence of interest expense on variable rate debt secured by Dominion Energy’s interest in Cove Point ($72 million), lower tax expense to reflect the deferred taxes on the outside basis of Questar Gas, Wexpro and related affiliates’ stock ($22 million), a gain upon the closing of the Questar Gas Transaction ($18 million) and the absence of an impairment charge of certain nonregulated solar assets ($11 million), partially offset by the absence of a gain on the sale of Dominion Energy’s remaining noncontrolling interest in Cove Point ($348 million), the absence of earnings from operations following the closing of the East Ohio Transaction ($206 million) and Questar Gas Transaction ($39 million), the absence of equity method earnings from the sale of Dominion Energy’s noncontrolling interest in Cove Point ($163 million), a loss on the closing of the East Ohio Transaction ($113 million), an impairment associated with the Questar Gas Transaction ($78 million), charges for employee benefit items related to the East Ohio Transaction ($33 million), a loss on the closing of the PSNC Transaction ($30 million) and higher tax expense associated with the PSNC Transaction ($16 million).

An analysis of Virginia Power’s results of operations follows:
 
Third Quarter 2024 vs. 2023

 Operating revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting:
 •A $137 million increase to recover the costs and an authorized return, as applicable, associated with non-fuel riders;
 •A $43 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth; and 
 •An $11 million increase in sales to customers from non-jurisdictional solar generation facilities.
 These increases were partially offset by:
 •A $40 million net decrease in fuel-related revenue as a result of a decrease in commodity costs associated with sales to electric utility retail customers, including revenue for the deferred fuel securitization and electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates and related settlements of economic hedges effective March 2024;
 •A $28 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with economic and other usage factors;
 •A $15 million decrease due to one-time credits to customers associated with the 2023 Biennial Review; and
 •An $11 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers, primarily due to a decrease in cooling degree days during the cooling season.
 Electric fuel and other energy-related purchases decreased 6%, primarily due to lower commodity costs for electric utilities ($64 million), partially offset by an increase in the use of purchased renewable energy credits ($19 million), which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.
 
Other operations and maintenance increased 8%, primarily reflecting:
 •A $31 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits and administrative costs;
 •A $24 million increase in certain expenditures which are primarily recovered through state- and FERC-regulated rates and do not impact net income; and
 •A $10 million increase in materials and supplies expense.
 These increases were partially offset by:
 •A $20 million decrease in storm damage and restoration costs; and
 •A $19 million decrease in bad debt expense.
 
Depreciation and amortization decreased 23%, primarily due to the absence of amortization of a regulatory asset established in the settlement of the 2021 Triennial Review ($61 million) and the absence of RGGI-related amortization ($36 million) and a decrease in amortization associated with Virginia Power non-fuel riders ($13 million), both of which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.

Other taxes increased 17%, primarily due to higher property taxes.
 
Impairment of assets and other charges increased $55 million, primarily due to a charge related to the write-off of certain early-stage development costs ($30 million) and the absence of a benefit related to dismantling costs and other activities associated with certain retired electric generation facilities ($13 million).
 
Other income increased $59 million, primarily due to net investment gains in 2024 compared to net investment losses in 2023 on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($47 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($16 million).
 
Interest and related charges increased 11%, primarily due to an increase in long-term debt borrowings ($44 million) and increased interest expense associated with rider deferrals ($15 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income, partially offset by a decrease in the outstanding balance of commercial paper and intercompany borrowings with Dominion Energy ($23 million).
 
Income tax expense increased 10%, primarily due to higher pre-tax income ($51 million), partially offset by a nuclear production tax credit ($36 million).


Year-To-Date 2024 vs. 2023
 Operating revenue increased 7%, primarily reflecting:
 •A $557 million increase to recover the costs and an authorized return, as applicable, associated with non-fuel riders;
 •A $108 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers, primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days during the cooling season ($78 million) and an increase in heating degree days during the heating season ($30 million);
 •A $94 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth;
 •A $61 million increase from electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates, including settlements of economic hedges prior to March 2024; and
 •An $11 million increase in sales to customers from non-jurisdictional solar generation facilities.
 These increases were partially offset by:
 •A $184 million decrease from the combination of certain riders into base rates as a result of 2023 Virginia legislation;
 •An $85 million net decrease in fuel-related revenue as a result of a decrease in commodity costs associated with sales to electric utility retail customers, including revenue for the deferred fuel securitization and electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates and related settlements of economic hedges effective March 2024;
 •A $62 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with economic and other usage factors; and
 •A $15 million decrease due to one-time credits to customers associated with the 2023 Biennial Review.
 Electric fuel and other energy-related purchases decreased 6%, primarily due to lower commodity costs for electric utilities, which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.
 
Other operations and maintenance increased 15%, primarily reflecting:
 •A $53 million increase in certain expenditures which are primarily recovered through state- and FERC-regulated rates and do not impact net income;
 •A $43 million increase from the combination of certain riders into base rates as a result of 2023 Virginia legislation;
 •A $27 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits and administrative costs;
 •A $22 million increase in materials and supplies expense;
 •A $13 million increase in outage costs;
 •A $12 million increase in outside services; and
 •An $11 million increase in tree trimming and vegetation management.
 
Depreciation and amortization decreased 7%, primarily reflecting:
 •The absence of $183 million in amortization of a regulatory asset established in the settlement of the 2021 Triennial Review; 
 •A $67 million decrease in amortization associated with non-fuel riders, which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income; and
 •A $13 million decrease due to revised depreciation rates for Bath County.
 These decreases were partially offset by:
 •A $143 million increase in RGGI-related amortization, which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income; and
 •A $29 million increase due to various projects being placed into service.
 
Other taxes increased 11%, primarily due to higher property taxes.
 
Impairment of assets and other charges increased 27%, primarily due to a charge related to the write-off of certain early-stage development costs ($30 million) and the absence of a benefit related to dismantling costs and other activities associated with certain retired electric generation facilities ($10 million), partially offset by the absence of a charge for the write-off of certain previously deferred amounts related to the cessation of certain riders effective July 2023 ($36 million).



Other income increased 92%, primarily due to an increase in net investment gains on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($54 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($21 million).
 
Interest and related charges increased 10%, primarily due to an increase in long-term debt borrowings ($129 million) and increased interest expense associated with rider deferrals ($23 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income, partially offset by a decrease in principal on commercial paper and intercompany borrowings with Dominion Energy ($86 million).
 
Income tax expense increased 24%, primarily due to higher pre-tax income ($128 million), partially offset by a nuclear production tax credit ($53 million).

Outlook

 
As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to Dominion Energy’s 2024 outlook as described in Item 7. MD&A in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As discussed in Future Issues and Other Matters, Virginia Power closed on the sale of a 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project to Stonepeak in October 2024, with such noncontrolling interest expected to decrease net income attributable to Dominion Energy beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 
Liquidity and Capital Resources

 Dominion Energy depends on both cash generated from operations and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and as a bridge to long-term financings. Dominion Energy’s material cash requirements include capital and investment expenditures, repaying short-term and long-term debt obligations and paying dividends on its common and preferred stock.

Operating Cash Flows

 Net cash provided by Dominion Energy’s operating activities decreased $809 million, inclusive of a $32 million increase from discontinued operations. Net cash provided by continuing operations decreased $841 million primarily due to lower deferred fuel and purchased gas cost recoveries ($250 million), settlements of interest rate swaps ($205 million) and an increase in interest payments driven by higher interest rates and borrowings ($81 million), higher net prepayments and deposits ($293 million) and $336 million primarily due to lower operating cash flows from electric utility operations, partially offset by an increase from changes in working capital ($324 million).
 
Investing Cash Flows

 Net cash from Dominion Energy’s investing activities increased $4.4 billion, primarily due to net proceeds from the East Ohio, Questar Gas and PSNC Transactions ($9.2 billion) and an increase in distributions from equity method affiliates ($125 million), partially offset by the absence of the net proceeds from the sale of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Cove Point ($3.3 billion), an increase in plant construction and other property additions ($1.6 billion) and higher acquisitions of solar development projects ($188 million).



Financing Cash Flows

 Net cash from Dominion Energy’s financing activities decreased $1.9 billion, primarily due to a $7.5 billion decrease due to net repayments on 364-day term loan facilities in 2024 versus net issuances in 2023, net repayment of credit facility borrowings ($900 million), the partial repurchase of the Series B Preferred Stock ($440 million) and net repayments of short-term debt ($214 million), partially offset by a $7.2 billion increase due to net issuances of long-term debt in 2024 versus net repayments in 2023.

 Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt

As discussed in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy generally uses proceeds from short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, to satisfy short-term cash requirements not met through cash from operations. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending on the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. There have been no significant changes to Dominion Energy’s use of credit facilities and/or short-term debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
 
Joint Revolving Credit Facility

 Dominion Energy maintains a $6.0 billion joint revolving credit facility which provides for a discount in the pricing of certain annual fees and amounts borrowed by Dominion Energy under the facility if Dominion Energy achieves certain annual renewable electric generation and diversity and inclusion objectives. At September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy had $2.4 billion of unused capacity under its joint revolving credit facility. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for the balances of commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding.

 Dominion Energy Reliability InvestmentSM Program

 Dominion Energy has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC for the sale of up to $3.0 billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called Dominion Energy Reliability InvestmentSM. The registration limits the principal amount that may be outstanding at any one time to $1.0 billion. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Dominion Energy Reliability Investment Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Dominion Energy or at the investor’s option at any time. At September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included $482 million presented within short-term debt. The proceeds are used for general corporate purposes and to repay debt.
 
Other Facilities

 In addition to the primary sources of short-term liquidity discussed above, from time to time Dominion Energy enters into separate supplementary credit facilities or term loans as discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
 In March 2024, Dominion Energy repaid the full $2.5 billion outstanding under its $2.5 billion 364-day term loan facility entered into in January 2023 as amended in January 2024, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the East Ohio Transaction. The debt was scheduled to mature in July 2024.
 In March 2024, Dominion Energy repaid $1.8 billion of its $2.25 billion 364-day term loan facility entered into in October 2023, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the East Ohio Transaction. Subsequently in March 2024, Dominion Energy requested and received a $500 million increase to the amount of the facility and concurrently borrowed $500 million with the proceeds used for general corporate purposes. In May 2024, Dominion Energy repaid the full $976 million outstanding under the facility, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the Questar Gas Transaction. The debt was scheduled to mature in October 2024.

Long-Term Debt

 
Sustainability Revolving Credit Facility

 Dominion Energy maintains a $900 million Sustainability Revolving Credit Facility which, following an amendment in June 2024, matures in June 2025 and bears interest at a variable rate and is described in Note 18 to the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The facility offers a reduced interest rate margin with respect to borrowed amounts allocated to certain environmental sustainability or social investment initiatives. In May 2024, Dominion Energy used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 EJSNs discussed below to repay the outstanding balance of $450 million under the Sustainability Revolving Credit Facility.
 
Issuances and Borrowings of Long-Term Debt


 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy issued or borrowed the following long-term debt.

 (1)Rate subject to periodic reset as described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 

 (2)The senior notes issued by PSNC were assumed by Enbridge upon closing of the PSNC Transaction in September 2024.
 Dominion Energy currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communication and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows Dominion Energy to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.
Dominion Energy anticipates, excluding potential opportunistic financings and the securitization bonds, issuing between approximately $3.0 billion and $4.8 billion of long-term debt during 2024, inclusive of amounts issued through September 30, 2024 as shown in the table above. Dominion Energy expects to issue long-term debt to satisfy cash needs for capital expenditures and maturing long-term debt to the extent such amounts are not satisfied from cash available from operations following the payment of dividends, proceeds from the completion of the sale of a 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project and any borrowings made from unused capacity of Dominion Energy’s credit facilities discussed above. The raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances.
 
Repayments, Repurchases and Redemptions of Long-Term Debt

 Dominion Energy may from time to time reduce its outstanding debt and level of interest expense through redemption of debt securities prior to maturity or repurchases of debt securities in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise.
The following long-term debt was repaid, repurchased or redeemed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Remarketing of Long-Term Debt

 In May 2024, Virginia Power remarketed three series of tax-exempt bonds, with an aggregate outstanding principal of $243 million to new investors. All three series of bonds will bear interest at a coupon of 3.80% until May 2027, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time.
 
Credit Ratings

 As discussed in the Companies’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Dominion Energy’s credit ratings affect its liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which it is able to offer its debt securities. The credit ratings for Dominion Energy are affected by its financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the applicable rating organization. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in Dominion Energy’s credit ratings from those described in the Companies’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. In June 2024, Standard & Poor’s revised its credit ratings outlook for Dominion Energy from negative to stable and affirmed all other current ratings.
 
Financial Covenants

 As discussed in the Companies’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Dominion Energy is subject to various covenants present in the enabling agreements underlying Dominion Energy’s debt.

Common Stock, Preferred Stock and Other Equity Securities

 In the Companies’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, there is a discussion of Dominion Energy’s existing equity financing programs, including Dominion Energy Direct®. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy issued $102 million of stock through these programs, net of fees and commissions. In May 2024, Dominion Energy entered into sales agency agreements to effect sales under a new at-the-market program, and through September 30, 2024 entered forward sale agreements for approximately 11.4 million shares of its common stock expected to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2024 at a weighted average initial forward price of $53.23 per share. In September 2024, Dominion Energy entered forward sale agreements for approximately 3.8 million shares of its common stock expected to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2025 at a weighted average initial forward price of $57.62 per share. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information.

Future Issues and Other Matters in the Companies’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, with the exception of the items described below.

 

CVOW Commercial Project

 In September 2019, Virginia Power filed applications with PJM for the CVOW Commercial Project and for certain approvals and rider recovery from the Virginia Commission in November 2021. The total cost of the project is estimated to be approximately $10 billion, excluding financing costs. Virginia Power’s current estimate for the 2.6 GW project’s projected levelized cost of energy, including renewable energy credits, is approximately $56/MWh, compared to the initial filing submission of $80-90/MWh. Virginia Power commenced major onshore construction activities in November 2023 following the receipt of a record of decision from BOEM in October 2023 for construction of the CVOW Commercial Project. Virginia Power commenced major offshore construction activities in May 2024 following the receipt in January 2024 of final approval from BOEM authorizing offshore construction and necessary permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for offshore construction. The project is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2026. Through September 30, 2024, Virginia Power had incurred approximately $5.3 billion of costs. In April 2024, a motion was filed in the U.S. District Court for the DC Circuit requesting a preliminary injunction in connection with a complaint filed related to the administrative process for certain permits and approvals received. In May 2024, the U.S. District Court for the DC Circuit denied the motion. As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Companies are subject to a cost sharing mechanism in accordance with the Virginia Commission’s order in December 2022 for incremental construction costs which fall between $10.3 billion and $13.7 billion. Also as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Virginia Power entered into an agreement in February 2024 to sell a 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project to Stonepeak through the formation of OSWP. In October 2024, Virginia Power and Stonepeak closed on the agreement following satisfaction of regulatory approvals, including from BOEM and the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. At closing, Virginia Power received $2.6 billion, representing 50% of the CVOW Commercial Project construction costs incurred through closing, less an initial withholding of $145 million. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for more information.
 

Offshore Wind Vessel Leasing Arrangement

 In December 2020, Dominion Energy signed an agreement (most recently amended in August 2024) with a lessor to complete construction of and lease a Jones Act compliant offshore wind installation vessel. This vessel is designed to handle current turbine technologies as well as next generation turbines. The lessor is providing equity and has obtained financing commitments from debt investors, totaling $715 million, to fund project costs. Including financing costs, total estimated project costs are approximately $715 million. The project is expected to be completed in early 2025. The initial lease term will commence once construction is substantially complete and the vessel is delivered and will mature after five years. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information.


Dominion Energy Virginia – Nuclear Operating Licenses

 In 2020, Virginia Power applied for renewal of its operating licenses for an additional 20 years for the two nuclear units at North Anna. In August 2024, the NRC approved Virginia Power’s application, allowing the units to generate electricity through 2058 and 2060.
 

Potential Regulated Electric Generation and Transmission Projects

In October 2024, Dominion Energy announced a joint planning initiative with AEP and FirstEnergy. As part of the initiative, the companies have jointly submitted initial project proposals for 765-kV, 500-kV and 345-kV transmission lines in Virginia, Ohio and West Virginia to PJM. If any such proposals are selected by PJM, the participating companies would then undertake an extensive, multi-year process to develop, construct and subsequently operate the transmission line.





ITEM 3.

 
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE

 
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 The matters discussed in this Item may contain “forward-looking statements” as described in the introductory paragraphs under Part I., Item 2. MD&A in this report. The reader’s attention is directed to those paragraphs for discussion of various risks and uncertainties that may impact the Companies.
 
Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management

 The Companies’ financial instruments, commodity contracts and related financial derivative instruments are exposed to potential losses due to adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity securities prices as described below. Commodity price risk is present in the Companies’ electric operations and Dominion Energy’s natural gas procurement and marketing operations due to the exposure to market shifts in prices received and paid for electricity, natural gas and other commodities. The Companies use commodity derivative contracts to manage price risk exposures for these operations. Interest rate risk is generally related to their outstanding debt and future issuances of debt. In addition, the Companies are exposed to investment price risk through various portfolios of equity and debt securities. The Companies’ exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is related to certain fixed price contracts associated with the CVOW Commercial Project which it manages through foreign currency exchange rate derivatives. The contracts include services denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for approximately €2.6 billion and 5.1 billion kr. In addition, certain of the fixed price contracts, approximately €0.7 billion, contain commodity indexing provisions linked to steel.
The following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential loss of future earnings or fair value from market risk sensitive instruments over a selected time period due to a 10% change in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.
 
Commodity Price Risk

 To manage price risk, the Companies hold commodity-based derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes associated with purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products.
 The derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are executed within established policies and procedures and may include instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps, options and FTRs that are sensitive to changes in the related commodity prices. For sensitivity analysis purposes, the hypothetical change in market prices of commodity-based derivative instruments is determined based on models that consider the market prices of commodities in future periods, the volatility of the market prices in each period, as well as the time value factors of the derivative instruments. Prices and volatility are principally determined based on observable market prices.
 A hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of $22 million and $62 million in the fair value of Dominion Energy’s commodity-based derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
 A hypothetical 10% decrease in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of $22 million and a hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of $24 million in the fair value of Virginia Power’s commodity-based derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
 The impact of a change in energy commodity prices on the Companies’ commodity-based derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net losses from commodity-based financial derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction, such as revenue from physical sales of the commodity.
 
Interest Rate Risk

 The Companies manage their interest rate risk exposure predominantly by maintaining a balance of fixed and variable rate debt. For variable rate debt outstanding for Dominion Energy, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would result in a $22 million and $56 million decrease in earnings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For variable rate debt outstanding for Virginia Power, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would result in an $7 million and $5 million decrease in earnings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
The Companies also use interest rate derivatives, including forward-starting swaps, interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements to manage interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had $10.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these interest rate derivatives outstanding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $50 million and $49 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s interest rate derivatives at September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy and

Virginia Power had $16.3 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these interest rate derivatives outstanding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $120 million and $151 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2023.
 The impact of a change in interest rates on the Companies’ interest rate-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net gains and/or losses from interest rate derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction.
 
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

 The Companies utilize foreign currency exchange rate swaps to economically hedge the foreign currency exchange risk associated with fixed price contracts related to the CVOW Commercial Project denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy had €1.5 billion and €2.1 billion, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these foreign currency forward purchase agreements outstanding. A hypothetical 10% increase in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease of $147 million and $202 million in the fair value of Dominion Energy’s foreign currency swaps at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
 The impact of a change in exchange rates on the Companies’ foreign currency-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net gains and/or losses from foreign exchange derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction.
 
Investment Price Risk

 The Companies are subject to investment price risk due to securities held as investments in nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust funds that are managed by third-party investment managers. These trust funds primarily hold marketable securities that are reported in the Companies’ Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
 
Dominion Energy recognized net investment gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of $1.0 billion, $409 million and $879 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Dominion Energy recorded in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains on debt investments of $41 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $117 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a net decrease of $14 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
 
Virginia Power recognized net investment gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of $526 million, $206 million and $448 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Virginia Power recorded in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains on debt investments of $25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a net decrease of $8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
 Dominion Energy sponsors pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans that hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments. Virginia Power employees participate in these plans. Differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are accumulated and amortized during future periods. As such, any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future increases in the net periodic cost recognized for such employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 Senior management of both Dominion Energy and Virginia Power, including Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of each company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation process, each of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s CEO and CFO have concluded that each company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
 
There were no changes that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Dominion Energy or Virginia Power’s internal control over financial reporting.



PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
