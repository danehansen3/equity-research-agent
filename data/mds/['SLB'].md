Schlumberger Limited fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by certain of its subsidiaries, including securities issued by Schlumberger Investment S.A. and Schlumberger Finance Canada Ltd., both indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Schlumberger Limited.


 8. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

SLB’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar. However, outside the United States, a significant portion of SLB’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies. Therefore, when the US dollar weakens (strengthens) in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which SLB conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will increase (decrease).

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates expose SLB to risks on future cash flows relating to its fixed rate debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. SLB uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to provide a hedge against these risks. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with the fair value of the derivative recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item is recognized in earnings.

Details regarding SLB’s outstanding cross-currency interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2024, were as follows:
•During 2019, a US-dollar functional currency subsidiary of SLB issued €1.5 billion of Euro-denominated debt. SLB entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps in order to hedge changes in the US dollar value of its €0.5 billion 0.00% Notes due 2024, €0.5 billion 0.25% Notes due 2027 and €0.5 billion 0.50% Notes due 2031. These cross-currency interest rate swaps effectively convert the Euro-denominated notes to US-dollar denominated debt with fixed annual interest rates of 2.29%, 2.51% and 2.76%, respectively.
•During 2020, a US-dollar functional currency subsidiary of SLB issued €0.8 billion of Euro-denominated debt. SLB entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the US dollar value of its €0.4 billion of 0.25% Notes due 2027 and €0.4 billion of 0.50% Notes due 2031. These cross-currency interest rate swaps effectively convert the Euro-denominated notes to US-dollar denominated debt with fixed annual interest rates of 1.87% and 2.20%, respectively. 
•During 2020, a US-dollar functional currency subsidiary of SLB issued €2.0 billion of Euro-denominated debt. SLB entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the US dollar value of its €1.0 billion of 1.375% Guaranteed Notes due 2026 and €1.0 billion of 2.00% Guaranteed Notes due 2032. These cross-currency interest rate swaps effectively convert the Euro-denominated notes to US-dollar denominated debt with fixed annual interest rates of 2.77% and 3.49%, respectively. 
•During 2020, a Canadian dollar functional currency subsidiary of SLB issued $0.5 billion of US dollar denominated debt. SLB entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the US dollar value of its $0.5 billion 1.40% Senior Notes due 2025. These cross-currency interest rate swaps effectively convert the US dollar notes to Canadian dollar denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.73%.

A summary of the amounts included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet relating to cross currency interest rate swaps was as follows:


|    |                      |                      |    |               |    |    |

|  5 | Other Assets         | $                    | 39 |               | $  | 36 |
|  6 | Other Liabilities    | $                    | 64 |               | $  | 67 |


The fair values were determined using a model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived or corroborated by observable data.

SLB is exposed to risks on future cash flows to the extent that the local currency is not the functional currency and expenses denominated in local currency are not equal to revenues denominated in local currency. SLB uses foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against a portion of these cash flow risks. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

SLB is also exposed to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. While SLB uses foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge this exposure as it relates to certain currencies, these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Instead, the fair value of the derivative is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, as are changes in the fair value of the hedged item.

Foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $7.1 billion and $5.4 billion in various foreign currencies as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Other than the previously mentioned cross-currency interest rate swaps, the fair value of the other outstanding derivatives was not material as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

SLB has issued credit default swaps (“CDSs”) to certain third-party financial institutions that have an aggregate notional amount outstanding of approximately $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. The CDSs relate to borrowings provided by the financial institutions to SLB’s primary customer in Mexico. The borrowings were used by this customer to pay certain of SLB’s outstanding receivables. Approximately $0.4 billion of the outstanding CDSs reduces on a monthly basis over its remaining 17-month term while the remaining $0.6 billion reduces on a monthly basis over its remaining 21-month term. The fair value of these derivative liabilities was not material at September 30, 2024.


 9. Contingencies

SLB is party to various legal proceedings from time to time. A liability is accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated. Management believes that the probability of a material loss with respect to any currently pending legal proceeding is remote. However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of any of these proceedings.

SLB delivered strong third-quarter 2024 results, achieving earnings growth and margin expansion due to its ongoing focus on cost optimization, greater adoption of SLB’s digital products and solutions, and the contribution of long-cycle projects in deepwater and gas.

This performance was achieved despite an environment where short-cycle activity growth softened, and some international producers exercised cautious spending triggered by lower oil prices and ample global supply, while land activity in the US remained subdued. Third-quarter 2024 global revenue of $9.2 billion was essentially flat with the second quarter of 2024. Revenue grew sequentially in the Middle East & Asia and offshore North America but was offset by a decline in Latin America, while Europe & Africa revenue was flat sequentially.
 
Although some customers have adopted a more cautious approach to their near-term capital expenditures and discretionary spending amid lower commodity prices, most projects are progressing as planned. Recent geopolitical events have further highlighted the importance of long-term energy security and reducing potential supply disruptions. SLB is well-positioned to navigate the evolving market conditions by leveraging its unique exposure to long-cycle projects in international, deepwater, and gas markets.

Digital & Integration

 Digital & Integration revenue of $1.1 billion increased 4% sequentially due to higher digital revenue while Asset Performance Solutions (“APS”) revenue was flat. Digital revenue grew 7% sequentially driven by the increased adoption internationally of our cloud, AI, and edge technology platforms.
 
Digital & Integration pretax operating margin of 36% expanded 456 basis points (“bps”) sequentially, mostly due to improved profitability in digital, following higher uptake of digital products and solutions and cost efficiencies.

Reservoir Performance


 Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.8 billion was flat sequentially as revenue grew in offshore North America and Latin America, offset by declines in Europe & Africa and Middle East & Asia.


Reservoir Performance pretax operating margin of 20% contracted 53 bps sequentially largely due to lower profitability in evaluation.
 
Well Construction

 Well Construction revenue of $3.3 billion declined 3% sequentially on lower revenue in measurements and fluids driven by lower drilling activity in Latin America, US land, and Saudi Arabia.
 
16




Well Construction pretax operating margin of 22% declined 19 bps sequentially due to reduced activity both in North America and internationally.
 
Production Systems

 Production Systems revenue of $3.1 billion increased 3% sequentially with growth primarily driven by higher sales of surface production systems and completions.
 
Production Systems pretax operating margin of 17% expanded 110 bps sequentially with improved profitability in surface production systems, completions, and artificial lift.

(1)“Net debt” represents gross debt less cash and short-term investments. Management believes that Net debt provides useful information to investors and management regarding the level of SLB’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt. Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, total debt.
 (2)Includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, exploration data costs, and APS investments.
(3)“Free cash flow” represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, APS investments and exploration data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of our ability to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, cash flow from operations. 
 
Key liquidity events during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 included:
•Capital investments (consisting of capital expenditures, APS investments and exploration data capitalized) were $1.9 billion during both the first nine months of 2024 and the first nine months of 2023. Capital investments for the full year 2024 are expected to be approximately $2.6 billion, which is the same level as the full year 2023.
 •In January 2024, SLB announced a 10% increase to its quarterly cash dividend from $0.25 per share of outstanding common stock to $0.275 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in April 2024. Dividends paid during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were $1.1 billion and $961 million, respectively.
 •As of September 30, 2024, SLB had cumulatively repurchased approximately $3.0 billion of SLB common stock under its $10 billion share repurchase program. 
 The following table summarizes the activity under the share repurchase program:
 
|    |                                                |            |       |              |      |               |    |       |

•During the second quarter of 2024, SLB issued $500 million of 5.00% Senior Notes due 2027, $500 million of 5.00% Senior Notes due 2029, and $500 million of 5.00% Senior Notes due 2034.
 •During the second quarter of 2024, SLB and Aker Carbon Capture ASA (“ACC”) announced the closing of their previously announced joint venture. The new company, SLB Capturi, combines technology portfolios, expertise, and operation platforms to support accelerated carbon capture adoption for industrial decarbonization at scale. At closing, SLB paid NOK 4.1 billion ($0.4 billion) in cash to ACC for the purchase of 80% of the shares in Aker Carbon Capture Holdings AS (“ACCH”), which held the business of ACC. ACC is also entitled to performance-based payments of up to NOK 1.4 billion if certain targets are met over the period from 2025 to 2027.
 After a lock-up period of three years, ACC is entitled to sell its 20% interest in ACCH to SLB during a period of six months for a price based on the fair market value of the combined business subject to a floor of NOK 1.0 billion and a ceiling of NOK 2.1 billion (the “put option”). Additionally, after the expiration of the put option, SLB has the right to purchase ACC’s 20% interest in the combined business during the following six months for a price based on the fair market value of the combined business subject to a floor of NOK 1.5 billion and a ceiling of NOK 2.6 billion.
 •During the first quarter of 2023, SLB sold all of its remaining approximately 9 million shares in Liberty and received proceeds of $137 million.
 As of September 30, 2024, SLB had $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand and committed debt facility agreements with commercial banks aggregating $5.0 billion, all of which was available. SLB believes these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months and beyond.
 SLB has a global footprint in more than 100 countries. As of September 30, 2024, only three of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of SLB’s net receivable balance. Only one of these countries, the United States, represented greater than 10% of such receivables. As of September 30, 2024, Mexico represented 9% of SLB's net accounts receivable balance. (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). SLB’s receivables from its primary customer in Mexico are not in dispute and SLB has not historically had any material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable relating to this customer.
 
On October 17, 2024, SLB entered into a definitive agreement to sell its interest in the Palliser APS project in Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, SLB will receive cash proceeds of approximately $430 million, subject to closing adjustments that are typical for such a transaction. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close late in the fourth quarter of 2024. SLB recorded revenue of approximately $0.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relating to this project.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

SLB has carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of SLB’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of SLB’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report.

SLB’s disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There was no change in SLB’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, SLB’s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 5. Other Information.

In 2013, SLB completed the wind down of its service operations in Iran. Prior to this, certain non-US subsidiaries provided oilfield services to the National Iranian Oil Company and certain of its affiliates (“NIOC”).
 
SLB’s residual transactions or dealings with the government of Iran during the third quarter of 2024 consisted of payments of taxes and other typical governmental charges. Certain non-US subsidiaries of SLB maintain depository accounts at the Dubai branch of Bank Saderat Iran (“Saderat”), and at Bank Tejarat (“Tejarat”) in Tehran and in Kish for the deposit by NIOC of amounts owed to non-US subsidiaries of SLB for prior services rendered in Iran and for the maintenance of such amounts previously received. One non-US subsidiary also maintained an account at Tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes. SLB anticipates that it will discontinue dealings with Saderat and Tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to SLB for prior services rendered in Iran.
