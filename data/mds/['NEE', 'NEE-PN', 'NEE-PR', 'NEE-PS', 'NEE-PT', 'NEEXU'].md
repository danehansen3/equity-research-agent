FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, strategies, future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as may result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, believe, will, could, should, would, estimated, may, plan, potential, future, projection, goals, target, outlook, predict and intend or words of similar meaning) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward looking. Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties. Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors (in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements) that could have a significant impact on NEE's and/or FPL's operations and financial results, and could cause NEE's and/or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of NEE and/or FPL in this combined Form 10-Q, in presentations, on their respective websites, in response to questions or otherwise.

Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks

•NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their business.
•NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if they are unable to recover in a timely manner any significant amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise.
•Regulatory decisions that are important to NEE and FPL may be materially adversely affected by political, regulatory, operational and economic factors.
•Any reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support utility scale renewable energy, including, but not limited to, tax laws, policies and incentives, renewable portfolio standards and feed-in-tariffs, or the imposition of additional taxes, tariffs, duties or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate or deliver it, could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new renewable energy projects, NEE and FPL abandoning the development of renewable energy projects, a loss of investments in renewable energy projects and reduced project returns, any of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
•NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected as a result of new or revised laws or regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations.
•NEE and FPL are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and other standards that may result in capital expenditures, increased operating costs and various liabilities, and may require NEE and FPL to limit or eliminate certain operations.
•NEE's and FPL's business could be negatively affected by federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on the production of greenhouse gas emissions.
•Extensive federal regulation of the operations and businesses of NEE and FPL exposes NEE and FPL to significant and increasing compliance costs and may also expose them to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions for compliance failures.
•Changes in tax laws, guidance or policies, including but not limited to changes in corporate income tax rates, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
•NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected due to adverse results of litigation.
•Allegations of violations of law by FPL or NEE have the potential to result in fines, penalties, or other sanctions or effects, as well as cause reputational damage for FPL and NEE, and could hamper FPL’s and NEE’s effectiveness in interacting with governmental authorities.

Development and Operational Risks

•NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer if NEE and FPL do not proceed with projects under development or are unable to complete the construction of, or capital improvements to, electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities or other facilities on schedule or within budget.
•NEE and FPL face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities.
•The operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities are subject to many operational risks, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
•NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be negatively affected by a lack of growth, slower growth or a decline in the number of customers or in customer usage.
•NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions and related impacts, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather.
•Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from geopolitical factors, terrorism, cyberattacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt NEE's and FPL's business, or the businesses of third parties, may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
•The ability of NEE and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEE's and FPL's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses.
•NEE invests in gas and oil producing and transmission assets through NEER’s gas infrastructure business. The gas infrastructure business is exposed to fluctuating market prices of natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil and other energy commodities. A prolonged period of low gas and oil prices could impact NEER’s gas infrastructure business and cause NEER to delay or cancel certain gas infrastructure projects and could result in certain projects becoming impaired, which could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
•If supply costs necessary to provide NEER's full energy and capacity requirement services are not favorable, operating costs could increase and materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
•Due to the potential for significant volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and renewable and other energy commodities, NEER's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively the commodity risks within its portfolios could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
•Reductions in the liquidity of energy markets may restrict the ability of NEE to manage its operational risks, which, in turn, could negatively affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
•NEE's and FPL's hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools may not protect against significant losses.
•If price movements significantly or persistently deviate from historical behavior, NEE's and FPL's risk management tools associated with their hedging and trading procedures may not protect against significant losses.
•If power transmission or natural gas, nuclear fuel or other commodity transportation facilities are unavailable or disrupted, the ability for subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, to sell and deliver power or natural gas may be limited.
•NEE and FPL are subject to credit and performance risk from customers, hedging counterparties and vendors.
•NEE and FPL could recognize financial losses or a reduction in operating cash flows if a counterparty fails to perform or make payments in accordance with the terms of derivative contracts or if NEE or FPL is required to post margin cash collateral under derivative contracts.
•NEE and FPL are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems, and any failure or breach of those systems could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
•NEE's and FPL's retail businesses are subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could result in a material adverse impact to their reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.
•NEE and FPL could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of derivative instruments and limited liquidity in OTC markets.
•NEE and FPL may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity.
•NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected if FPL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms with municipalities and counties in Florida.
•NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.
•NEE's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the energy industry.

Nuclear Generation Risks

•The operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities involve environmental, health and financial risks that could result in fines or the closure of the facilities and in increased costs and capital expenditures.
•In the event of an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, NEE and FPL could be assessed significant retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums as a result of their participation in a secondary financial protection system and nuclear insurance mutual companies.
•NRC orders or new regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require NEE and FPL to incur substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear generation facilities and/or result in reduced revenues.
•The inability to operate any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation units through the end of their respective operating licenses or planned license extensions could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
•NEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, and for other purposes. If planned outages last longer than anticipated or if there are unplanned outages, NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks

•Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets, among other factors, may negatively affect NEE's and FPL's ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and can also materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.
•NEE's, NEECH's and FPL's inability to maintain their current credit ratings may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's liquidity and results of operations, limit the ability of NEE and FPL to grow their business, and increase interest costs.
•NEE's and FPL's liquidity may be impaired if their credit providers are unable to fund their credit commitments to the companies or to maintain their current credit ratings.
•Poor market performance and other economic factors could affect NEE's defined benefit pension plan's funded status, which may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.
•Poor market performance and other economic factors could adversely affect the asset values of NEE's and FPL's nuclear decommissioning funds, which may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.
•Certain of NEE's investments are subject to changes in market value and other risks, which may materially adversely affect NEE's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
•NEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NEE.
•NEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if NEE is required to perform under guarantees of obligations of its subsidiaries.
•NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and on the value of NEE’s limited partner interest in NEP OpCo.
•Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may exert downward pressure on the market price of NEE's common stock.
•Widespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics may have material adverse impacts on NEE’s and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.
These factors should be read together with the risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in NEE's and FPL's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K), and investors should refer to that section of the 2023 Form 10-K. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and NEE and FPL undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including, but not limited to, unanticipated events, after the date on which such statement is made, unless otherwise required by law. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement.
Website Access to SEC Filings. NEE and FPL make their SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on NEE's internet website, www.nexteraenergy.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after those documents are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information and materials available on NEE's website (or any of its subsidiaries' or affiliates' websites) are not incorporated by reference into this combined Form 10-Q.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(unaudited)
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K. In the opinion of NEE and FPL management, all adjustments considered necessary for fair financial statement presentation have been made. All adjustments are normal and recurring unless otherwise noted. Certain amounts included in the prior year's condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. The results of operations for an interim period generally will not give a true indication of results for the year. 

1.  Revenue from Contracts with Customers

FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE’s operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers, as well as derivative (see Note 2) and lease transactions at NEER. For the vast majority of contracts with customers, NEE believes that the obligation to deliver energy, capacity or transmission is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits as NEE performs. NEE’s revenue from contracts with customers was approximately $6.7 billion ($4.9 billion at FPL) and $7.2 billion ($5.5 billion at FPL) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $18.2 billion ($13.2 billion at FPL) and $19.2 billion ($14.1 billion at FPL) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. NEE's and FPL's receivables are primarily associated with revenues earned from contracts with customers, as well as derivative and lease transactions at NEER, and consist of both billed and unbilled amounts, which are recorded in customer receivables and other receivables on NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated balance sheets. Receivables represent unconditional rights to consideration and reflect the differences in timing of revenue recognition and cash collections. For substantially all of NEE's and FPL's receivables, regardless of the type of revenue transaction from which the receivable originated, customer and counterparty credit risk is managed in the same manner and the terms and conditions of payment are similar.
FPL – FPL’s revenues are derived primarily from tariff-based sales that result from providing electricity to retail customers in Florida with no defined contractual term. Electricity sales to retail customers account for approximately 90% of FPL’s operating revenues, the majority of which are to residential customers. FPL's retail customers receive a bill monthly based on the amount of monthly kWh usage with payment due monthly. For these types of sales, FPL recognizes revenue as electricity is delivered and billed to customers, as well as an estimate for electricity delivered and not yet billed. The billed and unbilled amounts represent the value of electricity delivered to the customer. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, FPL's unbilled revenues amounted to approximately $764 million and $633 million, respectively, and are included in customer receivables on NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated balance sheets. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates through 2041. As of September 30, 2024, FPL expects to record approximately $360 million of revenues related to the fixed capacity price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided. These contracts also contain a variable price component for energy usage which FPL recognizes as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.
NEER – NEER’s revenue from contracts with customers is derived primarily from the sale of energy commodities, electric capacity and electric transmission. For these types of sales, NEER recognizes revenue as energy commodities are delivered and as electric capacity and electric transmission are made available, consistent with the amounts billed to customers based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts as well as an accrual for amounts earned but not yet billed. The amounts billed and accrued represent the value of energy or transmission delivered and/or the capacity of energy or transmission available to the customer. Revenues yet to be earned under these contracts, which have maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2055, will vary based on the volume of energy or transmission delivered and/or available. NEER’s customers typically receive bills monthly with payment due within 30 days. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to electric capacity sales through 2038, certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates through 2034, and capacity sales associated with natural gas transportation through 2062. At September 30, 2024, NEER expects to record approximately $1.2 billion of revenues related to the fixed price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided. The power purchase agreements also contain a variable price component for energy usage which NEER recognizes as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.

2.  Derivative Instruments

NEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, and to optimize the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. NEE and FPL do not utilize hedge accounting for their cash flow and fair value hedges.
With respect to commodities related to NEE's competitive energy business, NEER employs risk management procedures to conduct its activities related to optimizing the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets, providing full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engaging in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of prices in the energy markets. These risk management activities involve the use of derivative instruments executed within prescribed limits to manage the risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices. Transactions in derivative instruments are executed on recognized exchanges or via the OTC markets, depending on the most favorable credit terms and market execution factors. For NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge all or a portion of the expected output of these assets. These hedges are designed to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity markets associated with NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. With regard to full energy and capacity requirements services, NEER is required to vary the quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the customers served. For this type of transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated electricity quantities required to serve these customers and reduce the effect of unfavorable changes in the forward energy markets. Additionally, NEER takes positions in energy markets based on differences between actual forward market levels and management's view of fundamental market conditions, including supply/demand imbalances, changes in traditional flows of energy, changes in short- and long-term weather patterns and anticipated regulatory and legislative outcomes. NEER uses derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations, subject to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit exposure.
Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the condensed consolidated statements of income to which they relate. Transactions for which physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net basis in the condensed consolidated statements of income. For commodity derivatives, NEE believes that, where offsetting positions exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to have been netted and therefore physical delivery has been deemed not to have occurred for financial reporting purposes. Settlements related to derivative instruments are substantially all recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
For interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value, as well as the transaction gain or loss on foreign denominated debt, are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income. At September 30, 2024, NEE's AOCI included immaterial amounts related to discontinued interest rate cash flow hedges with expiration dates through October 2033 and foreign currency cash flow hedges with expiration dates through September 2030. 
Fair Value Measurements of Derivative Instruments – The fair value of assets and liabilities are determined using either unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) or other pricing inputs that are observable (Level 2) whenever that information is available and using unobservable inputs (Level 3) to estimate fair value only when relevant observable inputs are not available. NEE and FPL use different valuation techniques to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities, relying primarily on the market approach of using prices and other market information for identical and/or similar assets and liabilities for those assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. NEE's and FPL's assessment of the significance of any particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. Non-performance risk, including the consideration of a credit valuation adjustment, is also considered in the determination of fair value for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
NEE and FPL measure the fair value of commodity contracts using a combination of market and income approaches utilizing prices observed on commodities exchanges and in the non-exchange traded markets, or through the use of industry-standard valuation techniques, such as option modeling or discounted cash flows techniques, incorporating both observable and unobservable valuation inputs. The resulting measurements are the best estimate of fair value as represented by the transfer of the asset or liability through an orderly transaction in the marketplace at the measurement date.

Exchange-traded derivative assets and liabilities are valued using observable settlement prices from the exchanges and are classified as Level 1 or Level 2, depending on whether positions are in active or inactive markets.
NEE, through its subsidiaries, including FPL, also enters into non-exchange traded commodity derivatives. The majority of the valuation inputs are observable using exchange-quoted prices.
NEE, through NEER, also enters into full requirements contracts, which, in most cases, meet the definition of derivatives and are measured at fair value. These contracts typically have one or more inputs that are not observable and are significant to the valuation of the contract. In addition, certain non-exchange traded derivative options at NEE have one or more significant inputs that are not observable, and are valued using industry-standard option models.
In all cases where NEE and FPL use significant unobservable inputs for the valuation of a commodity contract, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. The primary input to the valuation models for commodity contracts is the forward commodity curve for the respective instruments. Other inputs include, but are not limited to, assumptions about market liquidity, volatility, correlation and contract duration as more fully described below in Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Fair Value Measurements. In instances where the reference markets are deemed to be inactive or do not have transactions for a similar contract, the derivative assets and liabilities may be valued using significant other observable inputs and potentially significant unobservable inputs. In such instances, the valuation for these contracts is established using techniques including extrapolation from or interpolation between actively traded contracts, or estimated basis adjustments from liquid trading points. NEE and FPL regularly evaluate and validate the inputs used to determine fair value by a number of methods, consisting of various market price verification procedures, including the use of pricing services and broker quotes to support the market price of the various commodities. Where there are assumptions and models used to generate inputs for valuing derivative assets and liabilities, the review and verification of the assumptions and models are undertaken by individuals in an independent control function.
NEE uses interest rate contracts and foreign currency contracts to mitigate and adjust interest rate and foreign currency exchange exposure related primarily to certain outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings when deemed appropriate based on market conditions or when required by financing agreements. NEE estimates the fair value of these derivatives using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing the net amount of estimated future cash inflows and outflows related to the agreements.

The tables below present NEE's and FPL's gross derivative positions at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as required by disclosure rules. However, the majority of the underlying contracts are subject to master netting agreements and generally would not be contractually settled on a gross basis. Therefore, the tables below also present the derivative positions on a net basis, which reflect the offsetting of positions of certain transactions within the portfolio, the contractual ability to settle contracts under master netting arrangements and the netting of margin cash collateral, as well as the location of the net derivative position on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

(a)Includes the effect of the contractual ability to settle contracts under master netting arrangements and the netting of margin cash collateral payments and receipts. NEE and FPL also have contract settlement receivable and payable balances that are subject to the master netting arrangements but are not offset within the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are recorded in customer receivables – net and accounts payable, respectively.
(b)Reflects the netting of approximately $148 million in margin cash collateral received from counterparties.
(c)Reflects the netting of approximately $307 million in margin cash collateral received from counterparties.
(d)Reflects the netting of approximately $815 million in margin cash collateral paid to counterparties.
At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, NEE had approximately $17 million (none at FPL) and $78 million ($3 million at FPL), respectively, in margin cash collateral received from counterparties that was not offset against derivative assets in the above presentation. These amounts are included in current other liabilities on NEE's condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, NEE had approximately $125 million (none at FPL) and $73 million (none at FPL), respectively, in margin cash collateral paid to counterparties that was not offset against derivative assets or liabilities in the above presentation. These amounts are included in current other assets on NEE's condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Fair Value Measurements – The valuation of certain commodity contracts requires the use of significant unobservable inputs. All forward price, implied volatility, implied correlation and interest rate inputs used in the valuation of such contracts are directly based on third-party market data, such as broker quotes and exchange settlements, when that data is available. If third-party market data is not available, then industry standard methodologies are used to develop inputs that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs, including some forward prices, implied volatilities and interest rates used for determining fair value are updated daily to reflect the best available market information. Unobservable inputs which are related to observable inputs, such as illiquid portions of forward price or volatility curves, are updated daily as well, using industry standard techniques such as interpolation and extrapolation, combining observable forward inputs supplemented by historical market and other relevant data.

Other unobservable inputs, such as implied correlations, block-to-hourly price shaping, customer migration rates from full requirements contracts and some implied volatility curves, are modeled using proprietary models based on historical data and industry standard techniques.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of NEE's commodity contracts categorized as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at September 30, 2024 are as follows:

(a)For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, FPL recorded approximately $6 million of losses and $46 million of gains, respectively, related to commodity contracts as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, respectively, on its condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, FPL recorded approximately $2 million of gains and $7 million of losses, respectively, related to commodity contracts as regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets, respectively, on its condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Notional Volumes of Derivative Instruments – The following table represents net notional volumes associated with derivative instruments that are required to be reported at fair value in NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated financial statements. The table includes significant volumes of transactions that have minimal exposure to commodity price changes because they are variably priced agreements. These volumes are only an indication of the commodity exposure that is managed through the use of derivatives. They do not represent net physical asset positions or non-derivative positions and the related hedges, nor do they represent NEE’s and FPL’s net economic exposure, but only the net notional derivative positions that fully or partially hedge the related asset positions. NEE and FPL had derivative commodity contracts for the following net notional volumes:

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, NEE had interest rate contracts with a net notional amount of approximately $30.5 billion and $25.6 billion, respectively, and foreign currency contracts with a notional amount of approximately $1.2 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively.
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features – Certain derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features including, among other things, the requirement to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified credit rating agencies and certain financial ratios, as well as credit-related cross-default and material adverse change triggers. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of NEE's derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was approximately $4.3 billion ($11 million for FPL) and $4.7 billion ($14 million for FPL), respectively.
If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these derivative agreements were triggered, certain subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, could be required to post collateral or settle contracts according to contractual terms which generally allow netting of contracts in offsetting positions. Certain derivative contracts contain multiple types of credit-related triggers. To the extent these contracts contain a credit ratings downgrade trigger, the maximum exposure is included in the following credit ratings collateral posting requirements. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to BBB/Baa2 (a three-level downgrade for FPL and a one level downgrade for NEECH from the current lowest applicable rating), applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post collateral such that the total posted collateral would be approximately $390 million (none at FPL) at September 30, 2024 and $510 million (none at FPL) at December 31, 2023. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post additional collateral such that the total posted collateral would be approximately $2.0 billion ($50 million at FPL) at September 30, 2024 and $2.4 billion ($15 million at FPL) at December 31, 2023. Some derivative contracts do not contain credit ratings downgrade triggers, but do contain provisions that require certain financial measures be maintained and/or have credit-related cross-default triggers. In the event these provisions were triggered, applicable NEE subsidiaries could be required to post additional collateral of up to

approximately $2.3 billion ($65 million at FPL) at September 30, 2024 and $1.7 billion ($50 million at FPL) at December 31, 2023.
Collateral related to derivatives, including amounts posted for margin, current exposures and future performance with exchanges and independent system operators, may be posted in the form of cash or credit support in the normal course of business. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, applicable NEE subsidiaries have posted approximately $190 million (none at FPL) and $691 million (none at FPL), respectively, in cash, and $1,404 million (none at FPL) and $1,595 million (none at FPL), respectively, in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds, each of which could be applied toward the collateral requirements described above. FPL and NEECH have capacity under their credit facilities generally in excess of the collateral requirements described above that would be available to support, among other things, derivative activities. Under the terms of the credit facilities, maintenance of a specific credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities, although there are other conditions to drawing on these credit facilities.
Additionally, some contracts contain certain adequate assurance provisions whereby a counterparty may demand additional collateral based on subjective events and/or conditions. Due to the subjective nature of these provisions, NEE and FPL are unable to determine an exact value for these items and they are not included in any of the quantitative disclosures above.

3.  Non-Derivative Fair Value Measurements

Non-derivative fair value measurements consist of NEE’s and FPL’s cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents, special use funds and other investments. The fair value of these financial assets is determined by using the valuation techniques and inputs as described in Note 2 – Fair Value Measurements of Derivative Instruments as well as below.
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Equivalents – NEE and FPL hold investments in money market funds. The fair value of these funds is estimated using a market approach based on current observable market prices.
Special Use Funds and Other Investments – NEE and FPL hold primarily debt and equity securities directly, as well as indirectly through commingled funds. Substantially all directly held equity securities are valued at their quoted market prices. For directly held debt securities, multiple prices and price types are obtained from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue of each security. Commingled funds, which are similar to mutual funds, are maintained by banks or investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of objectives. The fair value of commingled funds is primarily derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Because the fund shares are offered to a limited group of investors, they are not considered to be traded in an active market.
Fair Value Measurement Alternative – NEE holds investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which are initially recorded at cost, of approximately $586 million and $538 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's condensed consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to carrying values are recorded as a result of observable price changes in transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.

(a)Primarily represents investments accounted for under the equity method and loans not measured at fair value on a recurring basis (Level 2).
(b)Approximately $415 million and $567 million is included in current other assets and $235 million and $210 million is included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively (primarily Level 3).
(c)At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, substantially all is Level 2 for NEE and FPL.
Special Use Funds and Other Investments Carried at Fair Value – The special use funds noted above and those carried at fair value (see Recurring Non-Derivative Fair Value Measurements above) consist primarily of NEE's nuclear decommissioning fund assets of approximately $9,754 million ($6,824 million for FPL) and $8,697 million ($6,049 million for FPL) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The investments held in the special use funds and other investments consist of equity and available for sale debt securities which are primarily carried at estimated fair value. The amortized cost of debt securities is approximately $3,629 million ($1,777 million for FPL) and $3,329 million ($1,693 million for FPL) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Debt securities included in the nuclear decommissioning funds have a weighted-average maturity at September 30, 2024 of approximately eight years at NEE and eight years at FPL. Other investments primarily consist of debt securities with a weighted-average maturity at September 30, 2024 of approximately seven years. The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.
For FPL's special use funds, changes in fair value of debt and equity securities, including any estimated credit losses of debt securities, result in a corresponding adjustment to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts, consistent with regulatory treatment. For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, changes in fair value of debt securities result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for estimated credit losses and unrealized losses on debt securities intended or required to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are recognized in other – net in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income. Changes in fair value of equity securities are primarily recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds – net in NEE’s condensed consolidated statements of income.
Unrealized gains (losses) recognized on equity securities held at September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

———————————————
(a)    Unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were not material to NEE or FPL.
Regulations issued by the FERC and the NRC provide general risk management guidelines to protect nuclear decommissioning funds and to allow such funds to earn a reasonable return. The FERC regulations prohibit, among other investments, investments in any securities of NEE or its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates, excluding investments tied to market indices or mutual funds. Similar restrictions applicable to the decommissioning funds for NEER's nuclear plants are included in the NRC operating licenses for those facilities or in NRC regulations applicable to NRC licensees not in cost-of-service environments. With respect to the decommissioning fund for Seabrook, decommissioning fund contributions and withdrawals are also regulated by the New Hampshire Nuclear Decommissioning Financing Committee pursuant to New Hampshire law.
The nuclear decommissioning reserve funds are managed by investment managers who must comply with the guidelines of NEE and FPL and the rules of the applicable regulatory authorities. The funds' assets are invested giving consideration to taxes, liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements – NEE tests its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value. Indicators of impairment may include, among other things, an observable market price below NEE’s carrying value. Investments that are OTTI are written down to their estimated fair value on the reporting date and an impairment loss is recognized.
NextEra Energy Resources owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP, primarily through its limited partner interest in NEP OpCo, and accounts for this ownership interest as an equity method investment. During the third quarter of 2023, NEE recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.2 billion ($0.9 billion after tax) related to the investment in NEP, which is reflected in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE’s condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The impairment reflected NEE’s fair value analysis based on the market approach and the significant decline in the observable trading price of NEP’s common units at September 30, 2023 of $29.70 following an announcement of a decrease in NEP’s distribution growth rate expectations. Based on the fair value analysis, the equity method investment with a carrying amount of approximately $4.2 billion was written down to its estimated fair value of approximately $3.0 billion, which was the carrying amount as of September 30, 2023.
During the second and third quarters of 2024, NEE evaluated the investment in NEP for impairment because the trading price of NEP's common units had periodically fallen below NEE's carrying value per unit. At September 30, 2024, the trading price of NEP's common units exceeded NEE’s carrying value per unit of $27.61 and NEE has determined that the investment in NEP is not OTTI. In making this conclusion, NEE's analysis considered, among other things, the closing market price per unit on September 30, 2024, the extent to which the market value was less than the carrying value throughout the second and third quarters of 2024, the short duration of impairment, the conditions and trends of the economic cycle, analyst valuation reports, performance and trading yields of NEP and comparable public companies and trends in the general market. Should NEE determine, based on future analysis, that the impairment is other-than-temporary, an impairment loss would be recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE’s consolidated statements of income, which would impact future results.

4.  Income Taxes

NEE's effective income tax rate is based on the composition of pretax income or loss, and, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflects the impact on pre-tax income (income before income taxes) of the impairment charge related to the investment in NEP (see Note 3 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements).
A reconciliation between the effective income tax rates and the applicable statutory rate is as follows:

NEE recognizes PTCs as wind and solar energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes, which may differ significantly from amounts computed, on a quarterly basis, using an overall effective income tax rate anticipated for the full year. NEE uses this method of recognizing PTCs for specific reasons, including that PTCs are an integral part of the expected value of most wind and some solar projects and a fundamental component of such wind and solar projects' results of operations. PTCs, as well as ITCs, can significantly affect NEE's effective income tax rate depending on the amount of pretax income or loss. The amount of PTCs recognized can be significantly affected by wind and solar generation and by the roll off of PTCs after ten years of production absent a repowering of the wind and solar projects.

5.  Acquisitions

RNG Acquisition – On March 21, 2023, a wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources acquired a portfolio of renewable energy projects from the owners of Energy Power Partners Fund I, L.P. and North American Sustainable Energy Fund, L.P., as well as the related service provider (RNG acquisition). The portfolio primarily consisted of 31 biogas projects, one of which is an operating renewable natural gas facility and the others of which are primarily operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities. The purchase price included approximately $1.1 billion in cash consideration and the assumption of approximately $34 million of debt, excluding post-closing adjustments.
Under the acquisition method, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value. NEE acquired identifiable assets of approximately $1.3 billion, primarily relating to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets associated with biogas rights agreements and above-market purchased power agreements, and assumed liabilities of approximately $0.3 billion and noncontrolling interests of approximately $0.1 billion. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in approximately $0.3 billion of goodwill which has been recognized on NEE's condensed consolidated balance sheets, of which approximately $0.2 billion is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill associated with the RNG acquisition is reflected within NEER and, for impairment testing, is included in the clean energy assets reporting unit. The goodwill arising from the transaction represents expected benefits of synergies and expansion opportunities for NEE's clean energy businesses.

6.  Related Party Transactions

Through NEP OpCo, NEP owns, or has a partial ownership interest in, a portfolio of contracted renewable energy assets consisting of wind, solar and battery storage projects as well as a contracted natural gas pipeline. NEE owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP, primarily through its limited partner interest in NEP OpCo, and accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment. NextEra Energy Resources operates essentially all of the energy projects owned by NEP and provides services to NEP under various related party operations and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements (service agreements). NextEra Energy Resources is also party to a CSCS agreement with a subsidiary of NEP. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cash sweep amounts (due to NEP and its subsidiaries) held in accounts belonging to NextEra Energy Resources or its subsidiaries were approximately $51 million and $1,511 million, respectively, and are included in accounts payable. Fee income related to the CSCS agreement and the service agreements totaled approximately $5 million and $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $14 million and $55 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is included in operating revenues in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income. Amounts due from NEP of approximately $106 million and $84 million are included in other receivables and $127 million and $114 million are included in noncurrent other assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. NEECH or NextEra Energy Resources guaranteed or provided indemnifications, letters of credit or surety bonds totaling approximately $1.8 billion at September 30, 2024 primarily related to obligations on behalf of NEP's subsidiaries with maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2059, including certain project performance obligations and obligations under financing and interconnection agreements. Payment guarantees and related contracts with respect to unconsolidated entities for which NEE or one of its subsidiaries are the guarantor are recorded on NEE’s condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value. At September 30, 2024, approximately $59 million related to the fair value of the credit support provided under the CSCS agreement is recorded as noncurrent other liabilities on NEE's condensed consolidated balance sheet.
During 2024 and 2023, certain services, primarily engineering, construction, transportation, storage and maintenance services, were provided to subsidiaries of NEE by related parties that NEE accounts for under the equity method of accounting. Charges for these services amounted to approximately $192 million and $134 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $525 million and $520 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

7.  Variable Interest Entities

NEER – At September 30, 2024, NEE consolidates a number of VIEs within the NEER segment. Subsidiaries within the NEER segment are considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since they control the most significant activities of these VIEs, including operations and maintenance, and they have the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs.
Eight indirect subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have an ownership interest ranging from approximately 50% to 67% in entities which own and operate solar generation facilities with generating capacity of approximately 765 MW. Each of the subsidiaries is considered a VIE since the non-managing members have no substantive rights over the managing members, and is consolidated by NextEra Energy Resources. These entities sell their electric output to third parties under power sales contracts with expiration dates ranging from 2035 through 2052. These entities have third-party debt which is secured by liens against the assets of the entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NextEra Energy Resources for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs were approximately $1,727 million and $530 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024, and $1,796 million and $1,085 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the assets and liabilities of these VIEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and long-term debt.
NEE consolidates a NEET VIE which owns and operates an approximately 280-mile electric transmission line. A NEET subsidiary is the primary beneficiary and controls the most significant activities of the VIE. NEET is entitled to receive 48% of the profits and losses of the entity. The assets and liabilities of the VIE totaled approximately $699 million and $400 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024, and $741 million and $347 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the assets and liabilities of this VIE consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and long-term debt.
NextEra Energy Resources consolidates a VIE which has a 10% direct ownership interest in wind and solar generation facilities which have the capability of producing approximately 400 MW and 599 MW, respectively. These entities sell their electric output under power sales contracts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from 2025 through 2040. These entities are also considered a VIE because the holders of differential membership interests in these entities do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities. The assets and liabilities of the VIE were approximately $1,359 million and $81 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024, and $1,434 million and $79 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the assets of this VIE consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment.

NextEra Energy Resources consolidates 26 VIEs that primarily relate to certain subsidiaries which have sold differential membership interests in entities which own and operate wind generation, solar generation and battery storage facilities with the generating/storage capacity of approximately 9,700 MW, 2,838 MW and 1,519 MW, respectively. These entities sell, or will sell, their electric output either under power sales contracts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from 2024 through 2053 or in the spot market. These entities are considered VIEs because the holders of differential membership interests do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities. NextEra Energy Resources has financing obligations with respect to these entities, including third-party debt which is secured by liens against the generation facilities and the other assets of these entities or by pledges of NextEra Energy Resources' ownership interest in these entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NEER for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs totaled approximately $19,831 million and $701 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. There were 33 of these consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2023 and the assets and liabilities of those VIEs at such date totaled approximately $24,250 million and $3,148 million, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the assets of these VIEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment, and as of December 31, 2023, the liabilities of these VIEs consisted primarily of accounts payable.
Other – At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, several NEE subsidiaries had investments totaling approximately $5,787 million ($4,460 million at FPL) and $4,962 million ($3,899 million at FPL), respectively, which are included in special use funds and noncurrent other assets on NEE's condensed consolidated balance sheets and in special use funds on FPL's condensed consolidated balance sheets. These investments represented primarily commingled funds and asset-backed securities. NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, are not the primary beneficiaries and therefore do not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these entities, were not involved in the initial design of these entities and do not have a controlling financial interest in these entities.
Certain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method, including NEE's noncontrolling interest in NEP OpCo. These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners or non-managing members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are considered VIEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE’s investment in these entities totaled approximately $3,971 million and $3,913 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of one of these entities, as well as commitments to invest an additional approximately $185 million in several of these entities. See further discussion of such guarantees and commitments in Note 12 – Commitments and – Contracts, respectively.

(a)Includes tax exempt bonds that permit individual bondholders to tender the bonds for purchase at any time prior to maturity. In the event these tax exempt bonds are tendered for purchase, they would be remarketed by a designated remarketing agent in accordance with the related indenture. If the remarketing is unsuccessful, FPL would be required to purchase these tax exempt bonds. FPL's syndicated revolving credit facilities are available to support the purchase of tax exempt bonds. Variable interest rate is established at various intervals by the remarketing agent. 
(b)Variable rate is based on an underlying index plus a specified margin.
(c)Debentures issued in March 2024 and June 2024 will bear interest at the stated rate until September 1, 2029 and June 15, 2034, respectively, and thereafter will bear interest based on an underlying index plus a specified margin, reset every five years.
(d)See additional discussion of the exchangeable senior notes below.
(e)A foreign currency swap has been entered into with respect to this debt issuance. See Note 2.
(f)During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately $450 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities were repaid.
In March 2024, NEECH issued $1.0 billion principal amount of its exchangeable senior notes due 2027 (the notes). A holder may exchange all or a portion of its notes at any time prior to the maturity date in accordance with the related indenture. Upon exchange, NEECH will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes being exchanged and has the right, at its sole discretion, to pay or deliver cash, shares of NEE common stock or a combination of both, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEECH's exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being exchanged. At September 30, 2024, the exchange rate, which is subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the indenture, is 14.6927 shares of NEE common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $68.06 per share of NEE common stock.

NEECH used $52 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to enter into capped call transactions. Under the capped call transactions, NEECH purchased capped call options with an initial strike price of $68.06 and an initial cap price of $83.34 in each case per share of NEE common stock and subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The capped call transactions may be settled with cash or, at NEE's election, with shares of NEE common stock. Any capped call settlement value is expected to offset the value to be delivered upon exchange of the notes as a result of share price improvement up to the cap price. 
In June 2024, NEE sold $2.0 billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $50 and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially, a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series N Debenture due June 1, 2029, issued in the principal amount of $1,000 by NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than June 1, 2027 (the final settlement date) for a price of $50 in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments), based on a price per share range described in the following sentence. If purchased on the final settlement date, as of September 30, 2024, the number of shares issued per equity unit would (subject to antidilution adjustments) range from 0.6915 shares if the applicable market value of a share of NEE common stock is less than or equal to $72.31 (the reference price) to 0.5532 shares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than $90.38 (the threshold appreciation price), with the applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a 20-day trading period ending on May 26, 2027. Total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of 7.299%, consisting of interest on the debentures (5.15% per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (2.149% per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after December 1, 2026. A holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit. The undivided beneficial ownership interest in the NEECH debenture that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to NEE to secure the holder's obligation to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contract. If a successful remarketing does not occur on or before the third business day prior to the final settlement date, and a holder has not notified NEE of its intention to settle the stock purchase contract with cash, the debentures that are components of the Corporate Units will be used to satisfy in full the holders' obligations to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contracts on the final settlement date. The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.
On October 15, 2024, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources issued $633 million in principal amount of senior-secured limited-recourse notes with a 5.74% interest rate, maturing in 2049.

11.  Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies

Rate Regulation – In March 2024, the FPSC issued a supplemental final order regarding FPL's 2021 rate agreement. The order affirmed the FPSC's prior approval of the 2021 rate agreement and is intended to further document, as requested by the Florida Supreme Court, how the evidence presented led to and supports the FPSC's decision to approve FPL's 2021 rate agreement. In April 2024, Florida Rising, Inc., Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida, Inc. and League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida (collectively, the appellants) submitted a notice of appeal to the Florida Supreme Court regarding the FPSC's supplemental final order. The Florida Supreme Court issued an order granting FPL's motion to expedite the schedule. Oral arguments were held in October 2024, and the appeal remains pending.
In April 2024, the FPSC approved FPL’s March 2024 request for a mid-course correction to reduce the 2024 fuel cost recovery factors and refund customers approximately $662 million over eight months effective May 2024.
Storm Reserve Deficit – In August 2024 and September 2024, Hurricane Debby and Hurricane Helene, respectively, traveled through the Gulf of Mexico, eventually making landfall in Florida's Big Bend region, causing widespread outages. Although FPL has not finalized its storm restoration costs associated with Hurricanes Debby and Helene, FPL's preliminary estimate of total recoverable storm restoration costs is approximately $0.3 billion. Prior to Hurricane Debby, FPL's storm reserve had a balance of approximately $80 million. At September 30, 2024, the estimated recoverable storm restoration costs exceeded the balance of the storm reserve by approximately $0.2 billion. This deficit has been recorded by FPL as a current regulatory asset on NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated balance sheets.
In October 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the West Coast of Florida and traveled across the peninsula impacting much of FPL's service territory. Although FPL has not finalized its storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Milton, FPL's preliminary estimate of total recoverable storm restoration costs is approximately $0.8 billion.
Pursuant to FPL's 2021 rate agreement, storm restoration costs, plus an additional approximately $150 million to replenish the storm reserve, are recoverable from customers through a surcharge. FPL expects to file a petition in fourth quarter 2024 for a surcharge to be recovered over calendar year 2025 of approximately $1.2 billion. The final storm restoration costs are subject to a prudence review by the FPSC.

Restricted Cash – At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, NEE had approximately $311 million ($102 million for FPL) and $730 million ($15 million for FPL), respectively, of restricted cash, which is included in current other assets on NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash is primarily related to debt service payments and margin cash collateral requirements at NEER and bond proceeds held for construction at FPL. In addition, where offsetting positions exist, restricted cash related to margin cash collateral of $138 million is netted against derivative assets and $207 million is netted against derivative liabilities at September 30, 2024 and $194 million is netted against derivative assets and $815 million is netted against derivative liabilities at December 31, 2023. See Note 2.
Disposal of Businesses – In September 2024, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold 100% ownership interests in certain oil and gas shale formations and, as part of a joint venture (pipeline joint venture), sold an ownership interest, representing an approximately 15% economic interest, in three natural gas pipeline facilities located in the southern U.S. for total cash proceeds of approximately $101 million (subject to post-closing adjustments). A NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary has operated and will continue to operate two of the pipeline facilities included in the sale. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $120 million ($77 million after tax) was recorded in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net. Total assets of approximately $2,211 million, primarily property, plant and equipment and investment in equity method investees, and total liabilities of approximately $1,833 million, primarily long-term debt, were removed from NEE's balance sheet as a result of the transaction. NEE’s remaining interest, an approximately 85% economic interest, in the pipeline joint venture is a noncontrolling interest based on the governance structure of the joint venture and is reflected as an equity method investment of approximately $396 million at September 30, 2024. The fair value of NEE’s retained interest was calculated based on significant estimates and assumptions, including Level 3 (unobservable) inputs. Estimates and assumptions include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows, discount rates reflecting risk inherent in future cash flows and future market prices.
In September 2024, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold an ownership interest, representing an approximately 65% economic interest, as part of a joint venture (renewable assets joint venture), consisting of a portfolio of five wind generation facilities and three solar generation facilities located in geographically diverse locations throughout the U.S. with a total generating capacity of 1,634 MW, for cash proceeds of approximately $900 million. A NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary will continue to operate the facilities included in the sale. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $103 million ($76 million after tax) was recorded in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net. Total assets of approximately $2,520 million, primarily property, plant and equipment and total noncontrolling interests of approximately $844 million were removed from NEE's balance sheet as a result of the transaction. NEE’s remaining interest, an approximately 35% economic interest, in the renewable assets joint venture is a noncontrolling interest based on the governance structure of the joint venture and is reflected as an equity method investment of approximately $831 million at September 30, 2024. NEE expects to receive a distribution of approximately $390 million upon the projects in the renewable assets joint venture obtaining financing in the fourth quarter of 2024. The fair value of NEE’s retained interest was calculated based on significant estimates and assumptions, including Level 3 (unobservable) inputs. Estimates and assumptions include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows, discount rates reflecting risk inherent in future cash flows and future market prices. 
In June 2023, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold to a NEP subsidiary their 100% ownership interests in five wind generation facilities and three solar generation facilities located in geographically diverse locations throughout the U.S. with a total generating capacity of 688 MW for cash proceeds of approximately $566 million, plus working capital of $32 million. A NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary continues to operate the facilities included in the sale.

The charges associated with these agreements are recoverable through the fuel clause. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the charges associated with these agreements totaled approximately $103 million and $306 million, respectively, of which $24 million and $72 million, respectively, were eliminated in consolidation at NEE. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the charges associated with these agreements totaled approximately $104 million and $314 million, respectively, of which $25 million and $74 million, respectively, were eliminated in consolidation at NEE.
(b)Includes approximately $190 million of commitments to invest in technology and other investments through 2031. See Note 7 – Other.
(c)Includes approximately $345 million, $620 million and $190 million for the remainder of 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively, of joint obligations of NEECH and NEER.
Insurance – Liability for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this Act, NEE maintains $500 million of private liability insurance per site, which is the maximum obtainable, except at Duane Arnold which obtained an exemption from the NRC and maintains a $100 million private liability insurance limit. Each site, except Duane Arnold, participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides up to $15.8 billion of liability insurance coverage per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments of up to $1,161 million ($664 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S., payable at a rate not to exceed $173 million ($99 million for FPL) per incident per year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $20 million and $25 million, plus any applicable taxes, per incident, respectively.
NEE participates in a nuclear insurance mutual company that provides $2.75 billion of limited insurance coverage per occurrence per site for property damage, decontamination and premature decommissioning risks at its nuclear plants and a sublimit of $1.5 billion for non-nuclear perils, except for Duane Arnold which has a limit of $50 million for property damage, decontamination risks and non-nuclear perils. NEE participates in co-insurance of 10% of the first $400 million of losses per site per occurrence, except at Duane Arnold. The proceeds from such insurance, however, must first be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination before they can be used for plant repair. NEE also participates in an insurance program that provides limited coverage for replacement power costs if a nuclear plant is out of service for an extended period of time because of an accident. In the event of an accident at one of NEE's or another participating insured's nuclear plants, NEE could be assessed up to $169 million ($106 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, in retrospective premiums in a policy year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook, Duane Arnold and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $3 million, $2 million and $4 million, plus any applicable taxes, respectively.
Due to the high cost and limited coverage available from third-party insurers, NEE does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of either its transmission and distribution property or natural gas pipeline assets. If FPL's storm restoration costs exceed the storm reserve, such storm restoration costs may be recovered, subject to prudence review by the FPSC, through surcharges approved by the FPSC or through securitization provisions pursuant to Florida law. See Note 11 - Storm Reserve Deficit.
In the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers in the case of FPL, would be borne by NEE and FPL and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Legal Proceedings – FPL is the defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in February 2018 that seeks from FPL unspecified damages for alleged breach of contract and gross negligence based on service interruptions that occurred as a result of Hurricane Irma in 2017. There is currently no trial date set. The Miami-Dade County Circuit Court certified the case as a class action and FPL's appeal of that decision was denied by Florida's Third District Court of Appeal (3rd DCA) in March 2023. The class that was certified encompassed all persons and business owners who reside in and are otherwise citizens of the state of Florida that contracted with FPL for electrical services, were charged storm charges, experienced a power outage after Hurricane Irma and suffered consequential damages because of FPL’s alleged breach of contract or gross negligence. FPL filed a motion in March 2023, for rehearing with the 3rd DCA claiming that the opinion upholding the class certification contains several errors that should be reheard by the full 3rd DCA. Additionally, in July 2023, FPL filed in the circuit court a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis that, among other things, it believes the FPSC has exclusive jurisdiction over any issues arising from a utility's preparation for and response to emergencies or disasters. In May 2024, the 3rd DCA vacated its prior order which had upheld the circuit court's certification of the class, and remanded the proceeding to the circuit court to be stayed pending the plaintiffs obtaining a decision from the FPSC related to the sufficiency of FPL’s disaster preparedness. In June 2024, the plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing, rehearing en banc or certification with the 3rd DCA and that motion was denied in August 2024. In September 2024, the plaintiffs filed a request for the Florida Supreme Court to review the 3rd DCA's order decertifying the class and remanding and staying the case, which request remains pending. FPL is vigorously defending against the claims in this proceeding.
NEE, FPL, and certain current and former executives, are the named defendants in a purported shareholder securities class action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in June 2023 and amended in December 2023 that seeks from the defendants unspecified damages allegedly resulting from alleged false or misleading statements regarding NEE's alleged campaign finance and other political activities. The alleged class of plaintiffs are all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired NEE securities between December 2, 2021 and January 30, 2023. In September 2024, the class action lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On October 16, 2024, the lead plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. NEE is vigorously defending against the claims in this proceeding.
NEE, along with certain current and former executives and directors are the named defendants in purported shareholder derivative actions filed in the 15th Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach County, Florida in July 2023 and March 2024, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in October 2023 and November 2023 (which were consolidated in January 2024) and in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in July 2024 seeking unspecified damages allegedly resulting from, among other things, breaches of fiduciary duties and, in the consolidated cases and the July 2024 case, violations of the federal securities laws, all purporting to relate to alleged campaign finance law violations and associated matters. The defendants are vigorously defending against the claims in these proceedings. NEE and the plaintiffs in the derivative actions have agreed to a specified stay. NEE also has received demand letters and books and records requests from counsel representing other purported shareholders and containing similar allegations. These demands seek, among other things, a Board of Directors investigation of, and/or documentation regarding, these allegations. NEE and certain of the shareholders demanding an investigation have agreed to a specified stay of all material activities related to the demand.
In September 2023, a participant in the NEE Employee Retirement Savings Plan (Plan), purportedly on behalf of the Plan and all persons who were participants in or beneficiaries of the Plan at any time between September 25, 2016 and September 25, 2023 (Plan participants), filed a putative ERISA class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against NEE. The complaint alleges that NEE violated its fiduciary duties under the Plan by permitting a third-party administrative recordkeeper to charge allegedly excessive fees for the services provided and allegedly by allowing a large volume of plan assets to be invested in NEE common stock. The plaintiff seeks declaratory, equitable and monetary relief on behalf of the Plan and Plan participants. NEE and the plaintiff have agreed to a specified stay of the action to permit the plaintiff to exhaust the administrative remedies available under the Plan.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


OVERVIEW

NEE’s operating performance is driven primarily by the operations of its two principal businesses, FPL, which serves approximately 5.9 million customer accounts in Florida and is one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., and NEER, which together with affiliated entities is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun based on 2023 MWh produced on a net generation basis, as well as a world leader in battery storage. The table below presents net income (loss) attributable to NEE and earnings (loss) per share attributable to NEE, assuming dilution, by reportable segment, FPL and NEER. Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as other income and expense items, including interest expense, and eliminating entries, and may include the net effect of rounding. See Note 13 for additional segment information. The following discussions should be read in conjunction with the Notes contained herein and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations appearing in the 2023 Form 10‑K. The results of operations for an interim period generally will not give a true indication of results for the year. In the following discussions, all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year periods.

Adjusted Earnings

NEE prepares its financial statements under GAAP. However, management uses earnings adjusted for certain items (adjusted earnings), a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under NEE’s employee incentive compensation plans. NEE also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NEE’s management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NEE's fundamental earnings power. Although these amounts are properly reflected in the determination of net income under GAAP, management believes that the amount and/or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing. Adjusted earnings do not represent a substitute for net income, as prepared under GAAP.
The following table provides details of the after-tax adjustments to net income considered in computing NEE's adjusted earnings discussed above.

(a)    For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately $191 million of gains and $127 million of losses, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $44 million and $1,297 million of gains, respectively, are included in NEER's net income (loss); the balance is included in Corporate and Other. The change in non-qualifying hedge activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized.
(b)    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, includes an impairment charge related to the investment in NEP. See Note 3 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.
NEE segregates into two categories unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses and timing impacts related to derivative transactions. The first category, referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents certain energy derivative, interest rate derivative and foreign currency transactions entered into as economic hedges, which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting treatment is not elected or has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the condensed consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to certain of the positions are generally not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP. For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. The second category, referred to as trading activities, which is included in adjusted earnings, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of expected market price movements and all other commodity hedging activities. At FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 2.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Summary

Net income attributable to NEE increased by $633 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting higher results at NEER and FPL, partly offset by lower results at Corporate and Other. Net income attributable to NEE decreased by $357 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting lower results at Corporate and Other, partly offset by higher results at FPL and NEER. 
FPL's increase in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by continued investments in plant in service and other property. 
NEER's results increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflecting the absence of an impairment charge related to the investment in NEP recorded in 2023, favorable non-qualifying hedge activity compared to 2023 and higher earnings from new investments. NEER's results increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflecting the absence of an impairment charge related to the investment in NEP recorded in 2023 and higher earnings from new investments, partly offset by less favorable non-qualifying hedge activity compared to 2023. 
Corporate and Other's results decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to unfavorable non-qualifying hedge activity compared to 2023.
NEE's effective income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 0% and (5)%, respectively. NEE's effective income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 3% and 14%, respectively. See Note 4 for a discussion of NEE's and FPL's effective income tax rates. 

FPL: Results of Operations

Investments in plant in service and other property grew FPL's average rate base by approximately $6.0 billion and $6.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting, among other things, solar generation additions and ongoing transmission and distribution additions.
The use of reserve amortization is permitted by FPL's 2021 rate agreement. In order to earn a targeted regulatory ROE, subject to limitations associated with the 2021 rate agreement, reserve amortization is calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items must be adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. In certain periods, reserve amortization is reversed so as not to exceed the targeted regulatory ROE. The drivers of FPL's net income not reflected in the reserve amortization calculation typically include wholesale and transmission service revenues and expenses, cost recovery clause revenues and expenses, AFUDC – equity and revenue and costs not recoverable from retail customers. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, FPL recorded the reversal of reserve amortization of approximately $231 million and reserve amortization of $406 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, FPL recorded the reversal of reserve amortization of approximately $245 million and reserve amortization of $206 million, respectively. See Depreciation and Amortization Expense below. During all periods presented, FPL earned an approximately 11.80% regulatory ROE on its retail rate base, based on a trailing thirteen-month average retail rate base as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. In July 2024, FPL reduced the targeted regulatory ROE for the full-year 2024 to 11.40%.
FPL completed a twelve-month interim storm restoration charge that began in April 2023 for eligible storm restoration costs of approximately $1.3 billion, primarily related to surcharges for Hurricanes Ian and Nicole which impacted FPL's service area in 2022.
In the third quarter of 2024, FPL's service territory was impacted by Hurricanes Debby and Helene and FPL incurred recoverable storm restoration costs of approximately $0.3 billion. In October 2024, FPL's service territory was impacted by Hurricane Milton and FPL incurred recoverable storm restoration costs of approximately $0.8 billion. See Note 11 – Storm Reserve Deficit.
In March 2024, the FPSC issued a supplemental final order regarding FPL’s 2021 rate agreement. An April 2024 appeal of the order filed with the Florida Supreme Court by certain intervenors remains pending. See Note 11 – Rate Regulation. In September 2024, the license renewals for Turkey Point Unit No. 3 and Turkey Point Unit No. 4 were approved, extending the operating licenses to 2053 and 2054, respectively. Subsequently, an appeal of the decision dismissing all of the proposed contentions against the subsequent license renewal was filed with the NRC and that appeal is pending.

Operating Revenues

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating revenues decreased $536 million and $1,006 million, respectively, primarily reflecting decreases in storm cost recovery revenues of approximately $486 million and $745 million, respectively, primarily associated with the completion of surcharges for Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, as discussed above. Additionally, fuel revenues decreased approximately $110 million and $384 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily relating to lower fuel prices. The decreases in operating revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were partly offset by increases in retail base revenues of approximately $71 million and $184 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in retail base revenues was primarily related to an increase of approximately 2.1% and 1.9%, respectively, in the average number of customer accounts, partly offset by a decrease of 1.1% and 0.6%, respectively, in the average usage per retail customer driven by unfavorable weather when compared to the prior year periods.

Fuel, Purchased Power and Interchange Expense

Fuel, purchased power and interchange expense decreased $131 million and $442 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily reflecting lower fuel prices.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $450 million and $772 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects approximately $486 million of lower amortization of deferred storm cost expenses primarily associated with Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, as discussed above, partly offset by increased depreciation related to higher plant in service balances. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects approximately $745 million of lower amortization of deferred storm cost expenses primarily associated with Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, as discussed above, and the impact of reserve amortization, partly offset by increased depreciation related to higher plant in service balances. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, FPL recorded the reversal of reserve amortization of approximately $231 million and $245 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, FPL recorded reserve amortization of approximately $406 million and $206 million, respectively. Reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued asset removal costs provided under the 2021 rate agreement in order to achieve the targeted regulatory ROE. Reserve amortization is recorded as either an increase or decrease to accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2024, approximately $817 million of reserve amortization remains available under the 2021 rate agreement. 

NEER: Results of Operations

NEER’s results increased $1,453 million and $69 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The primary drivers, on an after-tax basis, of the changes are in the following table.

(c)    See Overview – Adjusted Earnings for additional information.


New Investments

Results from new investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to higher earnings related to new wind and solar generation and battery storage facilities that entered service during or after the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Customer Supply

Results from customer supply decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the normalization of origination activity and margins as compared to higher origination activity and margins in the prior year periods.

Other Factors

Supplemental to the primary drivers of the changes in NEER's results discussed above, the discussion below describes changes in certain line items set forth in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income as they relate to NEER.

Operating Revenues

Operating revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $916 million primarily due to:
•the impact of non-qualifying commodity hedges due primarily to changes in energy prices (approximately $574 million of gains for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $346 million of losses for the comparable period in 2023), and
•revenues from new investments of $148 million,
partly offset by,
•net decreases in revenues of $194 million from the customer supply and gas infrastructure businesses.
Operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $922 million primarily due to:
•the impact of non-qualifying commodity hedges due primarily to changes in energy prices (approximately $341 million of gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1,607 million of gains for the comparable period in 2023), and
•net decreases in revenues of $105 million from the customer supply and gas infrastructure businesses,
partly offset by,
•revenues from new investments of $338 million, and
•higher revenues from existing clean energy assets of $185 million primarily due the absence of 2023 refueling outages at the Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear facilities.

Operating Expenses – net

Operating expenses – net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $245 million primarily due to increases of $140 million in depreciation and amortization, $70 million in O&M expenses and $28 million in fuel, purchased power and interchange expenses. Operating expenses – net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $828 million primarily due to increases of $465 million in depreciation and amortization, $227 million in O&M expenses and $99 million in fuel, purchased power and interchange expenses. The increases for both periods were primarily associated with growth across the NEER businesses as well as higher depletion and higher O&M expenses at the gas infrastructure business.

Gains on Disposal of Businesses/Assets – net

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the changes in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net primarily reflect the September 2024 sales of ownership interests in connection with the pipeline joint venture and the renewable assets joint venture. See Note 11 – Disposal of Businesses.

Interest Expense

NEER’s interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $507 million reflecting approximately $329 million of unfavorable impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments as well as higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances. NEER’s interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $522 million reflecting approximately $294 million of unfavorable impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments as well as higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances.

Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees

NEER recognized $237 million and $578 million of equity in earnings of equity method investees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $954 million and $722 million of equity in losses of equity method investees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The change for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects the absence of an impairment charge in 2023 of approximately $1.2 billion ($0.9 billion after tax) related to the investment in NEP (see Note 3 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements).

Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities Held in NEER's Nuclear Decommissioning Funds – net

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, changes in the fair value of equity securities in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds related to favorable market conditions in 2024 compared to the prior year period.

Income Taxes

PTCs from wind and solar projects and ITCs from solar, battery storage and certain wind projects are included in NEER’s earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind and solar energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. NEER's effective income tax rate is primarily based on the composition of pretax income (loss) in the periods presented, as well as the amount of renewable energy tax credits in the periods presented. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, renewable energy tax credits increased by approximately $172 million and $435 million, respectively. See Note 4.
RNG Acquisition
On March 21, 2023, a wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources acquired a portfolio of renewable energy projects as well as the related service provider. See Note 5 – RNG Acquisition.

Corporate and Other: Results of Operations

Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates a portion of NEECH's corporate interest expense to NextEra Energy Resources. Interest expense is allocated based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries. 
Corporate and Other's results decreased $930 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to unfavorable after-tax impacts of approximately $930 million, as compared to the prior year period, related to non-qualifying hedge activity as a result of changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. Corporate and Other's results decreased $718 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to unfavorable after-tax impacts of approximately $743 million, as compared to the prior year period, related to non-qualifying hedge activity as a result of changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

NEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures (see Note 12 – Commitments), investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses (see Note 5), payment of maturing debt and related derivative obligations (see Note 9 and Note 2) and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, the issuance of short- and long-term debt (see Note 9) and, from time to time, equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors, the sale of renewable energy tax credits (see Note 11 – Income Taxes) and sales of ownership interests in assets/businesses to NEP or third parties (see Note 11 – Disposal of Businesses), consistent with NEE’s and FPL’s objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. NEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.

(a)    Provide for the funding of loans up to the amount of the credit facility and the issuance of letters of credit up to $3,200 million ($450 million for FPL and $2,750 million for NEECH). The entire amount of the credit facilities is available for general corporate purposes and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies’ or their subsidiaries’ operating facilities (including, in the case of FPL, a transmission and distribution property loss). FPL’s syndicated revolving credit facilities are also available to support the purchase of $1,663 million of pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds in the event they are tendered by individual bondholders and not remarketed prior to maturity, as well as the repayment of approximately $1,979 million of floating rate notes in the event an individual noteholder requires repayment at specified dates prior to maturity. Approximately $575 million of FPL's and $3,422 million of NEECH's syndicated revolving credit facilities expire over the next 12 months.
(b)    Only available for the funding of loans. Approximately $2,425 million of FPL's and $2,750 million of NEECH's bilateral revolving credit facilities expire over the next 12 months. 
(c)    Only available for the issuance of letters of credit. Approximately $1,680 million of the letter of credit facilities expire over the next 12 months.
(d)    Excludes short-term borrowings under NEECH's bilateral revolving credit facilities of $2,100 million, which are included in borrowings above.

Capital Support


Guarantees, Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Indemnifications (Guarantee Arrangements) 

Certain subsidiaries of NEE issue guarantees and obtain letters of credit and surety bonds, as well as provide indemnities, to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings. Substantially all of the guarantee arrangements are on behalf of NEE’s consolidated subsidiaries, as discussed in more detail below. See Note 6 regarding guarantees of obligations on behalf of NEP subsidiaries. NEE is not required to recognize liabilities associated with guarantee arrangements issued on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that they will be required to perform. At September 30, 2024, NEE believes that there is no material exposure related to these guarantee arrangements. 
NEE subsidiaries issue guarantees related to equity contribution agreements and engineering, procurement and construction agreements, associated with the development, construction and financing of certain power generation facilities (see Note 11 – Structured Payables) and a natural gas pipeline project, as well as a related natural gas transportation agreement. Commitments associated with these activities are included in the contracts table in Note 12.
In addition, at September 30, 2024, NEE subsidiaries had approximately $6.0 billion in guarantees related to obligations under purchased power and acquisition agreements, nuclear-related activities, payment obligations related to PTCs, support for NEER's retail electricity provider activities, as well as other types of contractual obligations (see Note 12 – Commitments).
In some instances, subsidiaries of NEE elect to issue guarantees instead of posting other forms of collateral required under certain financing arrangements, as well as for other project-level cash management activities. At September 30, 2024, these guarantees totaled approximately $1.1 billion and support, among other things, cash management activities, including those related to debt service and operations and maintenance service agreements, as well as other specific project financing requirements.
Subsidiaries of NEE also issue guarantees to support customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading activities, including the buying and selling of wholesale energy commodities. At September 30, 2024, the estimated mark-to-market exposure (the total amount that these subsidiaries of NEE could be required to fund based on energy commodity market prices at September 30, 2024) plus contract settlement net payables, net of collateral posted for obligations under these guarantees, totaled approximately $1.5 billion.
At September 30, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE also had approximately $5.6 billion of standby letters of credit and approximately $1.7 billion of surety bonds to support certain of the commercial activities discussed above. FPL's and NEECH's credit facilities are available to support substantially all of the standby letters of credit.
In addition, as part of contract negotiations in the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of NEE have agreed and in the future may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties, including those associated with asset divestitures, for possible unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may include, but are not limited to, an adverse judgment in a lawsuit, or the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretations of the tax law. NEE is unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments by its subsidiaries under some of these contracts because events that would obligate them to make payments have not occurred or, if any such event has occurred, they have not been notified of its occurrence.
NEECH, a 100% owned subsidiary of NEE, provides funding for, and holds ownership interests in, NEE's operating subsidiaries other than FPL. NEE has fully and unconditionally guaranteed certain payment obligations of NEECH, including most of its debt and all of its debentures registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees and indemnifications, and NEECH has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of subsidiaries within the NEER segment. Certain guarantee arrangements described above contain requirements for NEECH and FPL to maintain a specified credit rating.
NEE fully and unconditionally guarantees NEECH debentures pursuant to a guarantee agreement, dated as of June 1, 1999 (1999 guarantee) and NEECH junior subordinated debentures pursuant to an indenture, dated as of September 1, 2006 (2006 guarantee). The 1999 guarantee is an unsecured obligation of NEE and ranks equally and ratably with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of NEE. The 2006 guarantee is unsecured and subordinate and junior in right of payment to NEE senior indebtedness (as defined therein). No payment on those junior subordinated debentures may be made under the 2006 guarantee until all NEE senior indebtedness has been paid in full in certain circumstances. NEE’s and NEECH’s ability to meet their financial obligations are primarily dependent on their subsidiaries’ net income, cash flows and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to NEE and NEECH. The dividend-paying ability of some of the subsidiaries is limited by contractual restrictions which are contained in outstanding financing agreements.
Summarized financial information of NEE and NEECH is as follows:

Shelf Registration

In March 2024, NEE, NEECH and FPL filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified amount of securities, which became effective upon filing. The amount of securities issuable by the companies is established from time to time by their respective boards of directors. Securities that may be issued under the registration statement include, depending on the registrant, senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debentures, first mortgage bonds, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, warrants and guarantees related to certain of those securities. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that NEE believes are both most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and require complex, subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. NEE’s critical accounting policies and estimates were reported in NEE’s 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes regarding these critical accounting policies and estimates. 

See Note 3 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of an impairment analysis related to NextEra Energy Resources’ equity method investment in NEP.


ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING AND MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY

NEE and FPL are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of NEE and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year. Management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage such market risks, as well as credit risks.

Commodity Price Risk

NEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. See Note 2.
The changes in the fair value of NEE's consolidated subsidiaries' energy contract derivative instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:

With respect to commodities, NEE's Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is comprised of certain members of senior management, and NEE's chief executive officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The EMC and NEE's chief executive officer receive periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities.
NEE uses a value-at-risk (VaR) model to measure commodity price market risk in its trading and mark-to-market portfolios. The VaR is the estimated loss of market value based on a one-day holding period at a 95% confidence level using historical simulation methodology. The VaR figures are as follows:

(a)    The VaR figures for the trading portfolio include positions that are marked to market. Taking into consideration offsetting unmarked non-derivative positions, such as physical inventory, the trading VaR figures were approximately $2 million and $1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
(b)    Non-qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets or contracts which are not marked to market. The VaR figures for the non-qualifying hedges and hedges in FPL cost recovery clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements.

Interest Rate Risk

NEE's and FPL's financial results are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective outstanding and expected future issuances of debt, investments in special use funds and other investments. NEE and FPL manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates, entering into interest rate contracts and using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Interest rate contracts are used to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements.
The following are estimates of the fair value of NEE's and FPL's financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk:

(a)See Notes 2 and 3.

The special use funds of NEE and FPL consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of NEE's and FPL's nuclear power plants. A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities primarily carried at estimated fair value. At FPL, changes in fair value, including any credit losses, result in a corresponding adjustment to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment. The changes in fair value for NEE's non-rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for credit losses and unrealized losses on available for sale securities intended or required to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are reported in current period earnings. Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in longer-term securities.
At September 30, 2024, NEE had interest rate contracts with a net notional amount of approximately $30.5 billion to manage exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily associated with expected future and outstanding debt issuances at NEECH and NEER. See Note 2.
Based upon a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, the fair value of NEE's net liabilities would increase by approximately $3,107 million ($1,144 million for FPL) at September 30, 2024.

Equity Price Risk

NEE and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in prices for equity securities. For example, NEE’s nuclear decommissioning reserve funds include marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately $6,077 million and $5,290 million ($4,133 million and $3,536 million for FPL) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. NEE's and FPL’s investment strategy for equity securities in their nuclear decommissioning reserve funds emphasizes marketable securities which are broadly diversified. At September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the prices quoted on stock exchanges would result in an approximately $572 million ($381 million for FPL) reduction in fair value. For FPL, a corresponding adjustment would be made to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment, and for NEE’s non-rate regulated operations, a corresponding amount would be recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds – net in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income. See Note 3.

Credit Risk

NEE and its subsidiaries, including FPL, are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations. Credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. NEE manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and other collateral and guarantees.
Credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements. NEE’s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. For all derivative and contractual transactions, NEE’s energy marketing and trading operations, which include FPL’s energy marketing and trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Some relevant considerations when assessing NEE’s energy marketing and trading operations’ credit risk exposure include the following:
•Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry.
•Trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy, utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the U.S.
•Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies and is overseen by the EMC.
•Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral.
•Master netting agreements are used to offset cash and noncash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty. NEE’s policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties.
Based on NEE’s policies and risk exposures related to credit, NEE and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. At September 30, 2024, NEE's credit risk exposure associated with its energy marketing and trading operations, taking into account collateral and contractual netting rights, totaled approximately $2.9 billion ($74 million for FPL), of which approximately 90% (99% for FPL) was with companies that have investment grade credit ratings.

(a)    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of September 30, 2024, each of NEE and FPL had performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including NEE's and FPL's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of each company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of each of NEE and FPL concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

(b)    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

NEE and FPL are continuously seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and of their internal controls. This results in refinements to processes throughout NEE and FPL. However, there has been no change in NEE's or FPL's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during NEE's and FPL's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NEE's or FPL's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1. Legal Proceedings


See Note 12 – Legal Proceedings.

With regard to environmental proceedings to which a governmental authority is a party, NEE's and FPL's policy is to disclose any such proceeding if it is reasonably expected to result in monetary sanctions of greater than or equal to $1 million.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. The factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K, as well as other information set forth in this report, which could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects should be carefully considered. The risks described in the 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing NEE and FPL. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to NEE or FPL, or that are currently deemed to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect NEE's or FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
